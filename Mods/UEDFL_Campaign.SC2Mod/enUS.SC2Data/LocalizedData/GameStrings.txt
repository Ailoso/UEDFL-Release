Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M02_1=   "My death does not concern me.  I will die in time, it is imminent.<n/>     What keeps me awake at night is knowing that I cannot save<n/>     the ones I love before I die."<n/><n/>        -Unknown
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M02_2=    You, Commander, and Officer Davis escaped through the<n/>    francine facility sub-flooring before the facility went critical<n/>    and exploded.  As expected, the flames, burning at 70,000 <n/>    degrees, scorched the creatures and their structures out for<n/>    a half-mile.  <n/><n/>    Now moving through one of Odessa's sewer systems, you <n/>    both head  toward your precinct's last known rally point.<n/>    Unfortunately, the creature you fought in the francine <n/>    facility also followed you and Davis into the tunnels.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M03=   Within 48 hours of the first 'Roach' sighting, the United Powers<n/>   League (UPL) admitted globally that the creatures were part of<n/>   an extraterrestrial invasion.<n/><n/>   All local law enforcement and emergency personnel had been<n/>   federalized by the UPL and fell under the command of UPL's<n/>   armed forces.  Officer Myra Davis was transferred from Odessa<n/>   (which was secure) to Austin, Texas (where Roaches were <n/>   more widespread and had breached multiple police and military<n/>   barricades).<n/><n/>   Operation 'Beltway' began with shelling the city<n/>   from long range and 'Clean and Sweep' teams sent in<n/>   afterward to flush out and dispose of Roach stragglers.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M04=Continued alien attacks forced the United Powers League (UPL)<n/>to evacuate most civilian centers which created<n/>hundreds of millions of displaced refugees all over the globe.  <n/><n/>Agricultural and factory farm centers were very hard hit<n/>at the outset of the alien invasion leaving food in very short supply.<n/><n/>The UPL had marshalled its resources and initiated <n/>Operation Elpis, a coordinated world-wide <n/>counter-offensive against the invaders. <n/><n/>The UPL scored several key victories including the destruction of<n/>a major alien breeding center and turning away attacks <n/>against several key locations including London, Johannesburg, and Beijing. 
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M05=   With your demonstrated prowess on the battlefield Commander,<n/>   Colonel Graves has requested that you be reassigned to his <n/>   unit to address the roaches' fringe operations.<n/><n/>   The roaches have established multiple nests along the<n/>   shorelines of freshwater lakes around the world.  The first<n/>   of these nests, near Lake Baikal in Russia, was initially <n/>   regarded by Defense Net as a low priority target.  However,<n/>   within 96 hours roach activities had contaminated the lake<n/>   and decimated the ecosystems, threatening food supplies.<n/><n/>   Defense Net has now assigned tactical cells to eliminate<n/>   these nests as they're discovered, before future freshwater<n/>   and food supplies can be poisoned or destroyed.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M06=   It's been twelve days since the beginning of the roach invasion.<n/>   Following the successful mission at Lake Michigan, you were<n/>   transferred to a different unit due to shortages of command<n/>   staff within the UPL.<n/><n/>   You Commander, along with a C.A.R.R. unit and a UPL<n/>   SCOUT team are being sent on a classified mission to<n/>   Florida.  Mission details will be provided to you once you land.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M07=   Clean and Sweep initiatives combined with large area FAB<n/>   detonations had quelled the Roach advance in many parts<n/>   of the world including the Americas, Northern China, Japan,<n/>   and most of Europe.  Antarctica and Australia were not as <n/>   fortunate and had been completely overrun.<n/><n/>   And far away from the combat zones, UPL Defense Net<n/>   analysts discovered a pattern in Roach movements,<n/>   a pattern which could prove to be the aliens'<n/>   Achilles Heel.<n/><n/>   Admiral Hayes of the UPL, ranking officer for all military<n/>   forces, ordered the assembly of a special operations<n/>   unit for a top secret classified covert assignment.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M08=   The nuclear blast in the Appalachians was felt by populations<n/>   up to thirty miles away.  Admiral Hayes sent AWACS and <n/>   recon groups to gather video and thermal imaging of the<n/>   aftermath.  The pilots discovered a crater more than a half-<n/>   mile wide, and lying within it, they saw the pulsing outer<n/>   skin of what appeared to be a mountain of Roach brain<n/>   matter.<n/><n/>   UPL Intel and the Secretary General's scientific advisors <n/>   theorized, based on the visuals, that August had in fact been<n/>   destroyed and another intelligence took its place.  Images of<n/>   the creature growing in the crater, compared with images<n/>   sent back by Colonel Gideon's force during Operation Back-<n/>   swing debunked that hypothesis.<n/><n/>   August had survived...and was regenerating.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M09=   UPL forces established perimeters around Houston, Texas and <n/>   other mostly intact urban centers while enormous colony ships <n/>   inside were boarded by hundreds of people each.  The ships <n/>   all had a different destination star system, many light <n/>   years from Sol.<n/><n/>   To stall the Roaches' advance during the evacuation, the UPL<n/>   unleashed its nuclear stockpiles on nests all over the world.  <n/>   Though irradiating much of the earth in the process, the attacks <n/>   significantly depleted the Roaches' numbers and their ability <n/>   to wage war.<n/><n/>   With our cyber-infrastructure in ruins, information was conveyed<n/>   to the remaining human populations via short wave radio, <n/>   analog broadcasts, and even hard copy newspapers.
Map/LoadingBody/UEDFL_EP01M10=With the military facing desertions on a massive scale, <n/>the UPL has assembled the last of its regular forces, mercenaries,<n/>and paramilitary organizations to conduct one final operation.  <n/><n/>Fleet Admiral Hayes, the only UPL flag officer still alive, <n/>issued one final directive before all communication with the<n/>Everest complex went dark, <n/>"Do not give up hope, do not lose heart, the future of humanity<n/>depends on your willingness to fight, to sacrifice, <n/>and to keep the torch burning."

Map/LoadingHelp/UEDFL_EP01M07=Roach Blimps (a/k/a Pus Bags) will summon ground and air forces to attack you if they detect you.  Ensure you destroy them before they see you.

Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M00=All contact with the Tau Ceti mining colony was lost nine months ago following an expedition to hunt down Doran Routhe who was rumored to be hiding there.  The rescue ships sent to Tau Ceti also lost contact.  The UPL has now restricted travel to the colony due to fears that the star may have had a superflare event, flooding the system with lethal radiation.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M01=In a similar manner to the expeditions sent to Tau Ceti, contact with Lt. Rand's platoon on Charon was recently lost.  As solar storms prevented C.A.R.R.'s warning message from being heard, the UPL assumes that pirate activity was greater than originally thought, leaving earth unprepared for what comes next.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M02_1=The francine facility explosion was felt 500 miles away.  You, Commander, Davis, and Sgt. Peters were able to get clear when the alarms sounded.  You're now en route to rendezvous with the nearby riot group.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M02_2=All civilians in Odessa were successfully evacuated following the arrival of UPL reinforcements.  The UPL has achieved positive control of Odessa's downtown region and within a few days, retook the entire city.  Commander, you and Officer Davis have now been transferred to a different city where our forces are on the verge of defeat.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M03=Austin has been obliterated through a series of vacuum bombs despite the UPL's best efforts to retake it.  Most civilians were evacuated prior, and it is projected that tens of thousands of roaches were killed in the scorched earth action.  With global mobilization now fully underway, the UPL has determined it's time to go on the offensive.  
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M04=With total victory achieved in the Colorado refugee defense initiative, including the destruction of several key roach nests in the area, the UPL is redeploying your battalion to assist in further offensive operations.  
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M05=Lake Michigan and lakes around the world were salvaged before the roaches could do permanent damage, ensuring the stability of freshwater food supplies.  The UPL has now pulled you out of Graves' battalion for a covert assignment.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M06=Dr. Jennifer Halsey was flown to a classified location following her exfil.  Thanks to the successful extraction, she finished her work and provided the UPL Ruling Council with a method to end the war.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M07=The mission to destroy the roach supreme intelligence went according to plan.  The UPL has begun to reposition forces to mop up the high queen's now leaderless armies.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M08=Graves' entire brigade was destroyed to the last soldier attempting to hold the roaches at bay.  This did give the nearby colony ships the time needed to prep for launch.  UPL forces' sole focus is ensuring those ships break orbit  as they move toward their assigned star systems.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M09=With no colony ships escaping the roach attacks, and roaches replenishing their numbers at an astonishing rate, the UPL has one last mission it can undertake to save what's left of humankind.
Map/Summary/UEDFL_EP01M10=The UPL is gone.  Organized military resistance is gone.  There are no longshot plans to enact.  The end of the world, is just the beginning.

UserData/Lore/CARR Units_Description=The Combat and Reconnaisance Robot (C.A.R.R.) serves as adjutant to UPL military commanders on earth and on off-world colonies and settlements.  Originally designed by Galveston-Morey corporation, the CARR carries an onboard 37mm automatic cannon as well as an onboard grenade launcher.  While not normally deployed the frontlines, CARR units can more than adequately protect themselves and their human companions when the situation calls for it.<n/><n/>Galveston-Morey executives originally toyed with the idea of having CARR be a human replicant to better fit in with its combat units.  This concept yielded poor results in the field when soldiers and officers felt so uncomfortable around the artificial humans that they refused to partner with them.  It was ultimately decided that a robot that looks and sounds like a robot made soldiers feel much more comfortable and the current exoskeleton for CARR was born.  And with more than 5,000 deployed worldwide, the CARR is among the leading specialized defense products purchased by the UPL military.<n/><n/>Originally every CARR had a different designation such as KENT and WILL.  This cost lives during a key battle quashing a rebellion.  Soldiers were separated from their unit and under heavy fire.  They saw a robot on the field and tried to get its attention, yelling HERB!  HERB!.  That particular robot was named MIKE and ignored the soldiers' requests for assistance, resulting in the soldiers all being killed.  Following that debacle, the UPL renamed all robots to CARR.  While this can create an issue when more than one CARR is on the same field at the same time, it's the lesser evil.<n/><n/>The CARR unit on Tau Ceti has been specially modified by Doran Routhe himself, replacing its heavy armor chassis with nanite regeneration.  While this makes the CARR unit more vulnerable to incendiary and biological weapons which can burn or kill the nanites, projectile weapons are almost useless as any damage is almost instantly repaired.

UserData/Lore/M00-Commanders_Description=UPL forces no longer need to rely on local command and control to manage field operations, instead utilizing a commander from a remote base of operations, often hundreds of miles away from the area of engagement.<n/><n/>UPL Commanders utilize eyes in the sky to readily communicate with forces under their purview.  Literally an 'Eye,' the Commander's battlefield avatar is an orb that hovers through a combination of thrusters and magnetic fields.  The Avatar Orb allows the Commander to speak to troops on the field and field officers in real-time, without exposing the Commander to potentially deadly outcomes if operations go awry.<n/><n/>Should the Eye be destroyed, a new one can quickly be spooled up, linked to the Commander's encryption channel, and that's it.  The Eye moves at speeds that pace ground vehicles and can issue direct orders to any operator on the field without needing to first relay those instructions to field officers, though Commanders can do this if preferred.<n/><n/>UPL Commanders are typically housed in fortified underground bunkers which grant access to tactical and topographical maps, individual soldier health and vitals monitoring, vehicle status checks, and where applicable movements of the enemy.  Commanders also have access to most documented procedures in the civilian and military complex, whether that be the arming of nuclear devices, the technical schematics of vehicles and weaponry, and even obscure knowledge such as how to disable coolant flows in a Francine Processing Facility.<n/><n/>When the prowess and potency of UPL soldiers and officer is combined with the strategic resources available to UPL Commanders, it is a force to be reckoned with, and one of the methods the UPL has utilized to remain in power as the governing authority on earth.
UserData/Lore/M00-Commanders_Title=Commanders
UserData/Lore/M00-Tau Ceti_Description=With a population just north of 20,000 colonists, Tau Ceti is among five off-earth settlements of the United Powers League, the others being the Centauri Colonies, and research facilities on Pluto, Jupiter's Moon Europa, and the asteroid Ganymede.  Tau Ceti (in the constellation Cetus) is a series of linked large asteroids with most of the facilities being underground to shelter colonists from what is otherwise lethal radiation (no atmosphere).<n/><n/>The Tau Ceti planetoids orbit a single G-Class main sequence star which has ~85% the mass of earth's sun.  The colony is able to subsist despite the enormous costs of resupply through its comet farms.  Because Tau Ceti had several planets that never fully formed, there is a substantial increased presence of comets and the aforementioned asteroids in the system.  Those comets contain materials that cannot be acquired in the Sol system and are very useful in cryogenics and long haul space travel.  Nearly 90% of the colony's income is drawn from these comet farm operations.<n/><n/>Because the minerals and resources in the Tau Ceti system are so valuable, there is a substantial military force deployed there which is supplemented with guns-for-hire mercenaries.  The Tau Ceti colonists have a saying, "We don't want to know," which means that as long as you don't tell the colonists about your shady activities, criminal past, or who you're running from, they don't much care as long as you tow your weight.  This makes it an ideal refuge for Doran Routhe, the scientist responsible for the death of hundreds of millions on earth.  Routhe, having lost UPL protection, is the primary target of every bounty hunter between earth and Pluto.
UserData/Lore/M00-Tau Ceti_Title=Tau Ceti Comet Farms
UserData/Lore/M00-Trams_Description=When Tau Ceti was first founded, there were limited aerial support vehicles on hand and prolonged exposure to solar radiation was lethal (even with protective suits) when walking from one side of a planetoid to another.  The tram systems were deployed to mitigate this risk, transiting colonists long distance via an underground tube system.  As the colony thrived, more and more ships were stationed there (military and civilian), eliminating the need for the tram system.  Digging into the asteroids was time consuming and costly, and eventually the tram system was abandoned.<n/><n/>The trams are in good working order however, so with power restored, they are good as new.

UserData/Lore/M01-Alton Peters_Description=Sergeant Alton Peters has an identical twin brother on earth who entered law enforcement at the same time he entered the United Powers League military intra-solar tactical force (or M.I.S.T.)  On one occasion, Alton and Russell (his brother) swapped roles, each assuming the other's jobs for a day before realizing there was a reason one works in space and one works on the beat.  Ironically, both of the brothers attained the rank of Sergeant in their respective careers to date.

UserData/Lore/M01-Audiolog1_Description=This is Doctor Ben Melrose, the time is 22:51 earth standard, the day is September 28, 2248. This is Lazarus log seventeen. To recap progress so far, we found the culprit and hats off to Mr. Radek who caught the thing. It's been chewing up cabling to our solar panels for the last two days.  It is absolutely an extrasolar complex organism and yes, it...it appears to be ammonia based. I'm not sure how the physiology addresses the heat evaporation issue.

UserData/Lore/M01-Charon Station_Description=Charon Station (est. 2233) is the most advanced research complex in the solar system, and was built on Pluto's moon, Charon.  As Charon is tidally locked with Pluto, the same side of Charon always faces deep space and the UPL has situated an extensive number of telescopes on the dark side to take advantage of this.  As Charon has no atmosphere to speak of, the information gleaned from these powerful observatories has provided earth with some of the clearest views to the very beginning of the universe.<n/><n/>Charon orbits Pluto every 6 days, and has a diameter of 753 miles, or a bit less than half of Pluto itself.  With a composition of 55% soft rock and 45% ice, Charon was far more viable for construction of an underground facility than Pluto (which has much denser rock and less ice over its surface comparatively).  By day temperatures are -213 degrees C and by night, -258 degrees C.  With a gravity less than 10% that of earth, all personnel are required to wear magnetic footwear inside the facility following an earlier accident in which a scientist jumped, ecstatic about a discovery, and launched into a rotating industrial blade that was part of the facility's air circulation system.  The grate that normally covers the fan was removed during a repair cycle that same day.  The magnetic footwear also allows for double stacking usage of facility real estate, as up was down and scientists could walk on walls and ceilings.  Consoles and other equipment could be mounted on all four sides of a room, provided everything could fit.<n/><n/>The station itself has been attacked numerous times by pirate elements, so the facility has an extensive network of automated defenses, security robots, and a small squad of military personnel.  Despite this, the UPL has had to dispatch military platoons in multiple instances to purge the facility of intruders.

UserData/Lore/M01-Lilly Rollins_Description=While non-coms and officers sent on deep space expeditions are often the best the UPL military has to offer, enlisted personnel sent on such missions are often those with extensive disciplinary records, a history of lackluster performance, or those who have shown themselves to work 'just' hard enough not to be discharged before the end of their contract.  This fact is not unknown to the leaders sent on deep space runs, and has been a source of frustration for an otherwise excellent Lilly Rollins.<n/><n/>Rollins jumps in the slingshot any chance she gets to see the solar system, and if the price to pay is guiding around the worst bullet catchers the UPL has to offer, it's an acceptable trade off.  Most long haul assignments involve the tracking and capture or eradication of pirate elements, escaped fugitives, rebellious movements, or UPL military deserters.  Rollins is known for giving her quarry a single opportunity to surrender once they're found, saying what is now an infamous quote, "I'm giving you exactly one swig of oxygen to put your hands on top of your head."

UserData/Lore/M01-Redundancy_Description=The Charon facility, being the most remote UPL station in the solar system, has extremely long resupply cycles as even 10% the speed of light travel within the solar system is akin to certain death.  Any instance of power failure can be fatal to personnel stationed at Charon without the necessary equipment to perform repairs.  And re-supply ships require several months' transit due to debris in the solar plane.  With micro meteorites and other celestial impacts occurring regularly on Charon's primary solar farm, backup power sources are vital.  Charon Station has five such backup systems, including one that uses Charon's rotation to move a form of space turbine that is built into the moon's crust.

UserData/Lore/M01-Trevor Rand_Description=Rand has served in the UPL military since he was eighteen, and though he has already worked through his twenty, he cannot imagine doing anything else.  As long as the UPL will have him, he'll stay onboard another twenty, or until he's dead.  Other officers appreciate this as it means 'they' will not need to do a lot of the deep space runs that Rand is famous for.  Rand has earned significant repute in the UPL with unswerving ability to locate stealth enabled criminal craft in the solar system, even in the asteroid belt or Saturn's rings.  <n/><n/>With as many successful missions as Rand can claim, he has his choice of the litter in terms of non-coms, but as with any long haul operation, the enlisted personnel are still the bottom rung of military capability and force fed to Rand's unit.  Rand's ability to transform even the least effective soldiers into formidable fighting forces, (those who survived the missions anyhow), only further elevated Rand's status among UPL senior command.

UserData/Lore/M02P1-Boom_Description=Major corporations that have survived and thrived under the UPL police state include Galveston-Morey (weapons manufacturer), McCallister (conglomerate), and Zentratech (leaders in mechanized technology and artificial intelligence).  McCallister struck a deal with the regional magistrate that, in exchange for political contributions, the construction rights for several commercial facilities were theirs without any formal bidding process.  This practice is actually legal, and is a first come, first serve proposition, with the magistrate publishing the figure needed for a sole source contract.  <n/><n/>McCallister recently acquired a small lot in Odessa to build a satellite office, and has been blasting through every day of the week.  Not only is the noise cause for citizen unrest, but the site itself is dangerous, with McCallister just leaving explosives packed in barrels and unguarded on the lot when their crews fold their tents for the day.

UserData/Lore/M02P1-DeniseAlistair_Description=Denise Alistair has been part of the Odessa police force for over nine years.  She joined the special operations unit just over four years ago but ensured she is still assigned to the region where she was raised.  The UPL military has repeatedly attempted to recruit her into covert operations however she has refused, preferring the stability of her current role so she doesn't have to move her family every few years to various places around the globe.<n/><n/>Denise has kept you at a distance, Commander, though this has mainly been due to her distrust of UPL authority figures.

The shelter at the R Street stadium is considered unsafe and citizens are advised to seek alternatives.

UserData/Lore/M02P1-Francine_Description=<c val="FFFF00">Francine gas</c> is created through the very unstable process of merging francium and fluorine 'Franc-ine' together in a chemical reaction and harvesting the energy.  Francium's radioactive decay creates an extremely hot reaction that requires the coolant to manage.  It's that coolant you'll be shutting off when you get inside the facility.  After a short while, the facility's core will rupture and an area of nine city blocks will be obliterated.<n/><n/>While your team is unaware, Commander, you of course know that the very purpose of the UPL placing these facilities in urban centers is why you have this course of action available to you.  In the event a large portion of the population rebelled, the UPL would simply shut off the coolant and take care of the issue in an 'accidental explosion.'  That, and of course Francine is significantly less costly of a power source than fusion or fission.  So the UPL addresses two issues at once by having a power source that can also be used to quash insurrections.  It may not have sat well with you these past years Commander that a Francine explosion was just a button push away, but now, this UPL political fail safe is the single surest way to blow hundreds if not thousands of these creatures straight back to hell.

UserData/Lore/M02P1-Incinerators_Description=Incinerators are armed with a flamethrower mixture of plasma and white phosphorus.  The flames are impossible to extinguish as long as they are exposed to even the smallest amount of oxygen, and will still burn quite well submerged for several minutes.<n/><n/>Originally banned as an incendiary weapon by the world's former governments, the United Powers League reinstated the legality of these munitions as part of its wars against separatist nations not wishing to join the larger global order.  As for the incinerators, because they get 'up close and personal,' they have additional reinforced tungsten-carbide fibers woven into their armor to increase survivability.  This decision to reinstate the previously banned flame weapons proved very useful relative to the creatures attacking the city however, as the creatures appear as susceptible to the effects of the flames as other biological lifeforms.  <n/><n/>Incinerators are selected for their work as part of a social reacclimatization program, often being recruited out of federal prisons in exchange for shorter sentences.  Fortunately they appear to enjoy their work, and as long as the targets are widely available, they don't feel the need to turn the flamethrowers on friendly assets.

UserData/Lore/M02P1-MyraDavis_Description=Under the United Powers League, local law enforcement retains most autonomy on day-to-day matters, however it answers to a regional magistrate when multiple jurisdictions must coordinate.  Local police do not handle matters of the state, that is relegated to the UPL's Civic Awareness Division or C.A.D.<n/><n/>While Officer Davis has had multiple opportunities for promotion, she abhors the politics of higher echelon ranks and has opted instead to remain a patrol officer, to maintain ties with the community.  She consistently ranks in the top 10% of the region's police for marksmanship.  Davis is part of a trio of friends who joined the UPL enforcement training academy together, and who still put community ahead of the propaganda machine. Aside from Davis, there is Denise Alistair who went on to special operations, and Darren Rodgers who was recently assigned to run a desk.<n/><n/>Davis' repeated rejection of advancement offers drew the attention of Hank Slawson, local marshal of Internal Affairs ('Infernal Repairs' as the Darren Rodgers liked to call them), who regularly scrutinized Davis' arrests, reporting that Davis failed to use the appropriate amount force suitable for a given infraction.  In UPL terms, the more force used, the better.

UserData/Lore/M02P1-Surplus_Description=Because local law enforcement is not directly funded by the UPL State, it is often under-equipped and under-funded.  The City of Odessa police cruiser is actually a surplus patrol vehicle previously utilized by the military police.  The UPL military sells these vehicles to local law enforcement in an auction type scenario, meaning cities with less funding will simply get older equipment and less of it.  <n/><n/>Other types of equipment that are sold to local police as surplus include <c val="FFFF00">Healing Patch</c> implants, <c val="FFFF00">Flash Bang</c> grenades,<c val="FFFF00"> Incendiary</c> grenades, and specialized rifle scopes.  Because these items have very limited availability, they are only given to key personnel who go above and beyond to protect the community.
UserData/Lore/M02P1-Surplus_Title=Military Surplus
UserData/Lore/M02P2-Outposts_Description=The United Powers League military and regional law enforcement traditionally mobilize quickly when threats are identified, with or without tactical information.  This allows military forces to quickly subjugate rebellions or at the very least, slow them down, even if acting hastily costs the lives of soldiers unnecessarily.<n/><n/>Military forces are initially deployed in two stages when regions move to <c val="FFFF00">Threatcon Eris</c>, and those are probing forces, and outposts.  The probing forces will enter suspected hostile areas, report back what they discover, and if fortunate to survive, will complete reconnaisance missions and link up with larger combat groups that arrive afterward.<n/><n/>Outposts are force protection units which are sent with whatever personnel and equipment are able to be mobilized in time to meet the exigent need of the situation.  The higher the threat condition, the more likely the initial outpost will be supported by an under strength battalion.  Threat conditions themselves are misnomers since they mainly apply to terrorist actions.  The UPL did not anticipate the need for a separate list of conditions related to an invasion by hostile, aggressive monsters.

UserData/Lore/M02P2-Sewer System_Description=Although referred to as sewers, the underground water canals are actually streets of '<c val="FFFF00">Old Odessa</c>' that were flooded a century ago.  The regional governance board opted to build the new city on top of the ruins instead of demolishing the remnants and laying new foundations.<n/><n/>The sewers are neither efficient nor sewers by proper definition, as the water and wastewater is left standing until such time as levels rise high enough that it will be emptied into the ocean.  To combat what would become an unbearable odor in the city above, the UPL installed a local chemical dispersal system which injects <c val="FFFF00">ammonia</c> among other compounds into the standing water to neutralize the smell.  In short, all of the waste, none of the down side, unless you're standing in it.

UserData/Lore/M02P2-UndergroundTunnels_Description=What was a planned endeavor for Texas well before the absorption of the United States into the UPL, the <c val="FFFF00">Trans-Texas Underground Tunnel System (TTT or TT Tunnel System)</c> was originally an above ground ten lane planned route that was to connect major freight lines between Mexico and the US and would then jump off to major interstate roads for the last leg of long-haul runs.  The road <c val="FFFF00">never obtained funding</c> despite being put forward for legislative approval more than a dozen times between the year 2000 and 2120.<n/><n/>The UPL saw tremendous benefit of the endeavor from a military perspective however, as the tunnel system could be used as a rapid way to bypass traffic on other civilian roads in times of rebellion.  The concept was resurrected shortly after the UPL's formation except the tunnel was to be built underground.  The subterranean approach would allow for military movements to be hidden if there was urgent call to action.  Under normal conditions, the TTT was a civilian thoroughfare.  <n/><n/>The tunnels connect all major urban centers in the central and southern parts of the US as well as all major metropolises in Mexico.

UserData/Lore/M03-CSV_Description=The combat support vehicle (or CSV) is the backbone of UPL offensive and defensive operations.  It is able to defend itself in combat, but more importantly it utilizes a store of nanites to repair nearby armored and aerial vehicles.  The CSV is a force multiplier, and operates well in both small and large numbers.  For Clean and Sweep operations, the UPL has designated the CSVs as a defensive measure only.  The vehicles are deployed to barricades and tactical defensive locations, but are not often seen as part of any platoon or unit which is exterminating roach presence door to door.<n/><n/>The police utilize surplus CSV vehicles (with gun mounts removed) as their APC for special operations, with a fresh coat of paint of course.  As with all things nanite, they are still beholden to the laws of physics which means that they can only produce additional nanites or nanite components in a volume consistent with the 'food' they ingest.  Nanites cannot replicate out of thin air.  The common diet for nanites varies, depending on the components needing to be built.  Nanites consume the individual elements and then synthesize the alloy, circuit, or other element.  The case of repairs is much the same, which is why when the CSV's energy stores deplete, the nanites can no longer repair and must refocus to consuming more resources to build up the energy reserves.

UserData/Lore/M03-Fungus_Description=Roach structures appear to excrete a substance on the ground which Temple Blue has dubbed 'The Fungus.'  This substance is insidious as it chokes the oxygen from the soil and kills any smaller plant within hours and trees within days.  Even kudzu is choked off when the fungus takes root.  The fungus flows deep into the soil, contaminating water supplies in ways that the UPL does not yet understand.  For this reason, contaminated water supplies are repurposed for the coolant functions of francine gas facilities and fusion reactors.  The UPL has increased the production capability of seawater filtration plants to make up for freshwater lost in this way.<n/><n/>Additionally, the UPL has confirmed that the roaches cannot (or will not) construct most structures without fungus.  Why the roaches can grow some of their structures on any terrain and others only on the fungus is a mystery.
UserData/Lore/M03-Fungus_Title=The Fungus
UserData/Lore/M03-Invasion_Description=The roaches landed in both urban and rural areas globally and numbered in the tens of millions based on UPL estimates.  Within the five ensuing days, Corridor 9 estimates the roaches' population exceeds one billion.  It is not certain how the creatures are able to reproduce so quickly, except that they are extremely efficient in the conversion of earth's organics into the biological materials needed to facilitate the incubation.  The roaches do not have a maturity ramp, being birthed as adults with all combat capabilities immediately available.<n/><n/>While some strategic areas and bases were hit on day one of the invasion, Temple Blue (the UPL's intelligence coordination branch) believes the attacks are random.  The roaches do not appear to value one target over another, and those areas they did attack were simply the nearest to the roaches' landing sites.  For this reason, the UPL's factories and manufacturing complexes operate at nearly full capacity, and most bases are still able to train troops with minimal or no interference.<n/><n/>Unfortunately the UPL has fared far worse in the field.  The roaches do not exhibit any shock and awe reactions, and must be killed down to the last creature in any engagement.  They do not retreat, and even in the face of extensive losses within their own ranks, they are undeterred and press forward against UPL's forces.  Nor do the roaches regroup or tactically reposition.  The creatures just throw vast numbers at the desired site until UPL's defenses are worn down to the point our troops run out of ammunition and are forced to tactically withdraw.  The UPL's military strength is estimated to be at 60% of normal following several disasterous defeats, including the near annihilation of our naval forces.

UserData/Lore/M03-Newscast_Description=Tom Masterson: Good evening everyone, and thank you for switching into our broadcast, tonight we're going to address the elephant in the room; whether or not the creatures appearing around the world are in fact extraterrestrial in nature or whether they're human made. Weapons of the sepratist nations, aimed at de-stabilizing the United Powers League.<n/><n/>Marie Allen: That's right Tom, we'll also be discussing the UPL global response to this attack, how ground forces are being mobilized to contain the threat and what the response that might be towards those nations which are thought to be behind the attacks.<n/><n/>Tom Masterson: We're taking you first  to Dr. Hanna Reimer, a member of the bureau of Biological and Hazardous Materials Control. Hannah thank you for joining us tonight, will you tell our listeners and viewers what the bureau is seeing.<n/><n/>Dr. Reimer: It's my pleasure Tom, thank you for having me. The bureau has captured several specimens among the larger population of these creatures and we can say with certainty there are so far 5 to 6 species and multiple subspecies involved in the attacks. They each appear to have a part to play in the attacks, similar to the marabunta or Army Ants, we have workers, frontline soldiers, larger warriors and at least one species that displays a form of sapience; what the military refers to as blimps.<n/><n/>Marie Allen: Doctor, we are curious why are blimps used to describe the species?<n/><n/>Dr. Reimer: Well Marie, the creatures can suspend themselves 20 to 40 meters over the surface, without any discernible method of propulsion or lift, they just hang in the air like a blimp or hot air balloon, I think blimp just rolls off the tongue better-<n/><n/>Marie Allen: -We couldn't agree more, is the bureau designing any type of biological agent for large scale use against the creatures?<n/><n/>Dr Reimer: That is classified of course, we can say IF we move in that direction, it will be critical to ensure whatever we deploy is not also harmful to the human populations, though if some happens to drift toward the separatists, i don't think anyone will lose sleep over that.<n/><n/>Tom Masterson: As to their origins, is it the bureau's assessment that these creatures were deliberately placed in UPL territories by the separatists?<n/><n/>Dr Reimer: These are creatures, beasts, the snarl, they drool, they scratch, they have no spaceships, no technology of any kind. If they are extraterrestrial they have effectively moved through space with no method of locomotion. Trust me, these creatures are manufactured by humans.<n/><n/>Tom Masterson: Doctor Reimer, we appreciate your time tonight once again, and keep up the good fight! Now we have two more guests to provide additional insight on the UPL response to the situation, the first is Senator Niches from the Icelanding consortium. And also we have Lester G. Reigel, CEO of the McCallister Corporation, based out of his company's Headquarters in Caracas. Thank you for joining us tonight. My first question for you both is, how quickly will these creatures be eliminated and things get back to normal around here.<n/><n/>Lester Reigel: I'll take the first stab at this Senator if that's okay<n/><n/>Senator Niches: Gentleman first.<n/><n/>Lester Reigel: That's presuming a lot Senator, and Tom, Marie. We just completed and deployed the TR-17 mobile artillery units for the United Powers League three months ago, those units are experiencing tremendous success in the field. With the combination of powerful kinetics and white hot incendiaries, we've seen video footage of some of the creatures being launched 10 or 12 meters in the air from just a single shell.<n/><n/>Senator Niches: As my committee sponsored and approved the contract with McCallister I can also attest to the efficacy of the TR-17 tanks, and the best part of this scenario is we already have them deployed globally and in a complete state of readiness.<n/><n/>Lester Reigel: Senator i trust this situation might also compel you to revisit our request for the atmospheric carrier once the current crisis is-<n/><n/>Senator Niches: I would be careful what you choose to label as a crisis Lester! We have the situation very much under control, though clearly current events do show us we can never have too much defense at our disposal.<n/><n/>Lester Reigel: Senator, i could not agree more.<n/><n/>Marie Allen: Senator, we have heard the united powers league is considering a planetary draft.<n/><n/>Senator Niches: We are also considering whether or not to switch from coffee to tea in the US regional capitol building, is there a question in there somewhere?<n/><n/>Marie Allen: Uhhh, of course senator, we are all just curious if we'll get a chance to join the fight!<n/><n/>Senator Niches: Well, depending on circumstances, we will weigh all tactical options and then render a decision as we always do. You can rest assured that whatever the decision, this situation is under control. <n/><n/>Tom Masterson: Senator Niches, Mr Reigel, thank you both for your time today, and we look forward to having you on the show again tomorrow for another update. This is Tom Masterson and Marie Allen Bertram. Thank you everyone for switching in, we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.

UserData/Lore/M03-Sweep_Description=The UPL has adopted a framework to where heavy artillery is levied against concentrations of roach forces, and smaller groups of infantry and armor are deployed to sweep the impact sites and eliminate the remnants before they can regrow their nests.  Though tedious and slow, it has proven enormously effective against the roaches.  Whether there is one or thousands, roaches willingly attack UPL forces, allowing these mop-up operations to yield very high kill counts.<n/><n/>Though state media controls the broadcast networks, underground reporters have published that during 'Clean and Sweep' ops, the UPL has shelled urban areas without first ensuring the evacuation of citizens who may be trapped there.  Fleet Admiral Hayes, the ranking military officer of global operations, has denied these allegations.

UserData/Lore/M04-Colonel Graves_Description=William Graves is a lifer, coming up on his thirty, and he is more likely to be jettisoned from combat command due to forced retirement than his own desire to move on.  Graves has successfully walked the very fine line of defending the UPL's totalitarian regime from its enemies, while doing so in such a way that earns him the adoration of the general population.  Graves refuses to execute dissidents, rebels, and enemies upon capture as are the standard orders for any UPL military officer.  Graves is also one of the only officers known to openly defy the UPL Ruling Council directives when he feels there are better ways to diffuse incendiary situations.<n/><n/>As an example, Graves was ordered to firebomb a town for refusing to provide the UPL its gas reserves in support of the army's attempt to quell a rebellion in a neighboring region.  Graves negotiated with the townspeople, and was able to acquire the fuel supplies through diplomacy, without a single shot fired or civilian harmed.  In exchange for the fuel, the civilians were guaranteed they would not see its townsfolk drafted into future conflicts for at least twelve months.  He then told the UPL that the townspeople were too physically weak for service.  <n/><n/>The reason the Ruling Council tolerates Graves' insubordination is simple.  He wins battles.  He is able to overcome superior numbers and firepower through novel tactics and a defiance of standard military doctrine to create unexpected replies to enemy movements.  He fully expects that when he 'does' retire, he will 'be' retired as the UPL has a long memory of his defiance.

UserData/Lore/M04-Refugees_Description=Following the roach invasion of earth, populations from major urban centers were displaced, as well as farmers and ranchers from factory farming operations.  It is unclear what the roaches are looking for with the factory farms, aside from depriving the UPL of valuable food supplies.  The local refugee center in Utah (that you are protecting) is swelling by the day, and potable water supplies as well as food reserves are rapidly depleting.  There also appears to be drastic reduction in the sightings of wild fauna in the region.<n/><n/>It is expected that even if the roaches are held at bay in your combat theater, civilians in Utah will encounter mass starvation within two weeks if a solution to the food supply issue is not solved rapidly.

UserData/Lore/M04-Riley Jerico_Description=<c val="FFFF00">Sergeant Riley Jerico</c> is Colonel Graves' highest ranking NCO and is outfitted with an enhanced Z-2 battlesuit which comes with unique abilities including a jet pack.  Her gun, named 'Lorna' in honor of her sister who died in the line of duty, has a special ability of its own.  Jerico particularly enjoys using her rifle in hand-to-hand, beating the roaches to a pulp.<n/><n/>Jerico herself has served with Graves for her entire career, though the same cannot be said of CARR, where it's not uncommon for Graves and Jerico to rebuild multiple CARR adjutants during any engagement.  Jerico had joined one of the manhunts for Doran Routhe several years back, taking her to the Centauri colony.  Upon her arrival, it was determined that Routhe had fled to Tau Ceti a few months before.  Jerico passed that information on to the next mercenary group which disappeared when contact was lost with Tau Ceti.

UserData/Lore/M04-Routhe Tank_Description=<c val="FFFF00">Routhe Tanks</c> are the most heavily armored vehicles in the United Powers League (UPL) and are named after the mad scientist Doran Routhe (whose colonization project ended in what is known as the 'Gantris Disaster' nearly twenty years ago).  Though his career ended in disgrace, and he was responsible for taking part in the genocidal 'Project Purification,' on behalf of the UPL Ruling Council, Routhe was not without his advocates.  Several UPL generals honored his memory in the naming of this combat vehicle.<n/><n/>Many UPL states have demanded the vehicle's moniker be changed so it does not honor the memory of a homocidal lunatic, however the UPL Ruling Council has been reticent to do so.  Doran Routhe's very name instilled fear among earth's population like no other, and the Ruling Council believes that the tank will have the same effect on its enemies, simply due to the designation.  It is expected that the Routhe will be retired at some point in the next ten years and replaced with the newer railgun and particle beam weapon platforms that are soon to be out of prototype stage.  For now however, the name sticks, a cold reminder of darker times.<n/><n/>It is widely believed that Routhe fled to the Tau Ceti colony many years ago, but contact with the colony was lost about a year before the roaches invaded earth.  It is thought the roaches attacked Tau Ceti first, and Routhe met the end he deserved...being devoured alive by the carnivorous creatures that now assault humanity.

UserData/Lore/M04-Z1_Description=The <c val="FFFF00">Zentratech Corporation Model 1 (Z-1)</c> battlesuit is designed to bridge the gap between infantry and armor on the field.  Originally designed as a true exoskeleton (Model 0), this became untenable as infantry were still fully exposed to incoming weapons fire.  Only a fully enclosed mechanized suit allowed infantry to gain the protection of a light tank while still maintaining the nimbleness and mobility of close quarter operators.<n/><n/>Often called 'Battle Buddies' as they soak up incoming damage to give cover to advancing infantry forces, the Z-1 platoons are also highly effective at reconnaisance and defensive operations as standalone assets.  The Z-2 (a more advanced model) is deployed often to off-earth operations where resupply is difficult, and is provided to non-coms in the field who are expected to see heavy action on the front lines.
UserData/Lore/M04-Z1_Title=Battle Buddy
UserData/Lore/M05-NoBunkers_Description=The UPL determined early-on that its infantry doctrine would be offensive in nature.  This means more mobile, but more lightly armored ground pounders than were originally conceived with heavier bulky armor.  This allows infantry units to move more rapidly on covert runs and recon runs.  The downside is survivability, as if these infantry platoons are caught in the open, they do not have the durability of the aforementioned heavily armored marine concept.  (It should be noted that at the time the sociopath Doran Routhe supervised the launching of his four supercarriers, the bulky marine armor was frontrunner for outfitting UPL military forces, and as such was the schematic loaded to the supercarrier archives, and it's this that evolved into the infantry armor of choice in the Koprulu Sector a couple centuries later).<n/><n/>Because UPL infantry are offensive instead of defensive, the idea of bunkers was dismissed.  It was thought bunkers would simply postpone the inevitable, which is having lightly armored infantry with no change in weapon profile being temporarily shielded from attack.  Instead, Osprey helicopters were outfitted with a passenger hold to deploy four infantry units behind enemy lines, the combat support vehicle has an onboard med-station to patch up battle wounds for infantry, and the UPL constructed offensive structures for infantry to use in driving a wedge forward in any field of operations.  The Nightjar and Solitaire are used for this purpose, allowing infantry to gain the protection and firepower of armored vehicles while still retaining their mobility. <n/><n/>It's not uncommon for UPL infantry platoons to advance, take a tactical objective, deploy some Nightjar or Solitaire buildings, and when the time comes to press forward, infantry abandon those buildings, take a new tactical objective, and set up some more to maintain area superiority.  If the infantry is forced to retreat, they can return to the Nightjars and Solitaires they left behind as part of a counterattack.

UserData/Lore/M05-Stress_Description=The United Powers League possesses a globalized military force which is the composite of 93% of nations' militaries around the world.  Unlike past earth empires however (such as Britain in the 1700s), where different countries were allowed to use their own uniforms and flags as part of the larger force, everything about the UPL's military is unified.  All uniforms, vehicles, flags, and rank structures are the same across all nations.  This lent itself to an intimidating aspect toward the civilian population as it projected 'power' and 'reach' for the world organization.<n/><n/>The roaches' invasion immediately changed this paradigm, as some individual nations found themselves cut off from the whole within a week of first landing, and had to figure out means to fabricate their own weapons when the global networks were partially impaired.  For example, the United States produced robotic exoskeletons but endoskeletal systems were produced in China.  Both parts were then shipped to Iceland for assembly.  This was by design of the UPL to prevent any one nation from having means to rise up against the world order, and is part of the reason that the UPL was not able to bring all of its forces to bear everywhere earlier.<n/><n/>Different regions were only able to fabricate limited vehicles and infantry equipment until local factories were retrofitted to produce the required elements.  This change has effectively made the UPL nations autonomous as they were prior to the UPL's foundation.  Unfortunately this is not sustainable, as even with retrofitted assembly plants, the supplies needed to produce all of the equipment are globalized as well.  This is causing shortages in unit types in some regions and therefore is reducing combat effectiveness.  If supply shortages continue to mount, it will be that, as much as the constantly replenishing roach forces, that result in more defeats for the global military effort.

UserData/Lore/M05-ToxicDump_Description=Much about the roaches' biology is unknown, though many trial and error field tests have yielded some consistency.  It is known the roaches are immune to nerve agents, biological toxins (such as botulism or thergris), and actual poison.  The roaches do not appear to consume slain UPL soldiers or fauna, instead taking those carcasses away to unknown locations.  It is also reported that the roaches take living victims away as well, but this has yet to be confirmed.<n/><n/>From what UPL's science wings (codenamed Temple Blue, Temple Green, and Temple Red) can discern, the roaches attack vigorously and then, if not killed, will return to their nests and rest atop the excretions that the roaches' structures spread along the ground (what has come to be known as 'the Fungus').  It is theorized by one of Temple Blue's leading scientists, Dr. Jennifer Halsey, that the roaches derive nutrients from the fungus itself, rather than eating, though may require actual food if the fungus is in short supply.<n/><n/>Some UPL members call the time after a battle when roaches return to the fungus to regain their strength to be 'naptime' as things quiet down considerably until the roaches are rejuvenated, and then they attack again en masse.  The fungus itself is known to have a wildly detrimental effect on soil toxicity, where even areas cleared of the fungus reveal that what was previously fertile soil is now inhospitable to any type of seed (and likely will be for decades).  Similarly, the fungus' effect on water is largely the same, in which the molecular structure is slightly altered upon contact, rendering it unbreathable to fish and undrinkable to people and animals.  Unlike the soil however, the effects on water can be reversed as the fungus is diluted, provided that the roach nests dumping their excretions into large bodies of water are put out of commission quickly.<n/><n/>Nests which are grown near large bodies of water are termed 'Toxic Waste Dumps' by the UPL.

UserData/Lore/M06-Legacy_Description=<c val="FFFF00">Dr. Jennifer Halsey</c> is one of the top researchers of the United Powers League, and is a specialist in exo-linguistics and particle physics.  Following the failure of Doran Routhe's colonization mission, Halsey was selected to join the team as part of a second colonization attempt, however this initiative was scrapped with the arrival of the roaches.<n/><n/>Halsey has attempted to communicate with the roaches or at least identify how the roaches communicate without success.  She was instrumental in determining they have a hive mind however, which allowed the UPL to pinpoint the high queen's location.<n/><n/>The UPL recruited Halsey before she completed her second year at her university and she has been in the employ of the military ever since.  To say that humanity's hopes were riding with the work she is doing would not be an understatement.

UserData/Lore/M06-Meteor_Description=The prison facility 'Meteor' long served as a dark box, where enemies of the UPL, their associates, families, dissenters, and others deemed undesirable in the world order but for which public execution was not warranted, were housed.  It is the place people go to disappear, when they can't be disappeared.  <n/><n/>There's a saying coined by the facility's warden, "They're not dead if they're on the books," which means that so long as the death of prisoners was never reported, they were in essence still alive as far as the UPL is concerned.  This is how the prison has ten times as many inmates registered as can be housed in its cells.  Following the roach invasion, key research facilities in several urban centers were destroyed.  It was deemed unlikely the roaches knew the importance of these facilities, they were likely just collateral damage as the roaches attacked everything indiscriminately.<n/><n/>Following the loss of these facilities, other UPL covert sites, such as the prison, were retrofitted into makeshift research offices until more permanent sites could be established away from the frontlines.  For Meteor, this meant ejecting the prisoners when UPL research staff took over.  And that's exactly what the UPL did.  All prisoners were released, but left to their own devices to navigate through the surrounding trees, a dense forest that extended twenty miles in any direction.  Most prisoners perished upon encountered roaches which were burrowed in the woodlands.  Some prisoners managed to escape and run back to the prison, bringing roaches with them.  It's for this reason Meteor was discovered by the roaches at all.

UserData/Lore/M06-Temples_Description=The UPL had three distinct 'official' research wings.  The unofficial wing (Corridor 9) answered to the Ruling Council directly and was not part of the standard chain of command.<n/><n/>Codename: Temple <c val="FF0000">Red</c><n/><n/>For standard R&D which revolves around conventional armaments, fusion power, and experimental weapons.<n/><n/>Codename: Temple <c val="00FF00">Green</c><n/><n/>All research revolving around robotics, artificial intelligence, and biological weapons.<n/><n/>Codename: Temple <c val="0000FF">Blue</c><n/><n/>Research based on exigent threats, and to address areas not covered in Red or Green.  Temple Blue is not called into service except to address very specific situations, and then researchers are returned to their normal duties once the given crisis has passed.  For the present time, Temple Blue addresses all aspects of the roach invasion, including research into their mode of reproduction, motives, tactics, vulnerabilities, and weapons which can devastate their number as well as defensive measures which can better withstand them.  The Raptor Jet's Scatterbombs were specifically engineered as weapons to counter the roaches' large clustered numbers.

UserData/Lore/M07-August_Description=The UPL dedicated all of its research arms to deriving methods of defeating the roaches, however it is the team at Temple Blue, led by Jennifer Halsey, which determined how the roaches were governed by a single intelligence.  Originally it was suspected that blimps, princesses, and lower queens served in the capacity of battlefield officers.  It was through several trial and effort exercises that the UPL realized these other creatures did not possess a consciousness, even if they held some degree of sapience in carrying out the hive mind's instructions.<n/><n/>Several covert missions were undertaken previously to kill what the UPL thought was the high intelligence nonetheless, with each codenamed a month of the year.  After July, the research facility where Dr. Halsey was working came under attack by the roaches and she required evacuation.  Before leaving she was able to utilize movements of the roach princesses and lower queens to trace the position of a new creature.  The images from the Satellite Net yielded a high concentration of blur, but Halsey was able to spot an outline of a roach creature unlike any other previously seen.  It is this creature that is codenamed August, and what is now thought to be the governing intelligence for the entire roach invasion.

UserData/Lore/M07-Gideon_Description=Richard Gideon started with the UPL military straight out of the post-secondary military academy (PSMA).  When students reach the 10th grade in any public school system within a UPL nation, that student is given a choice.  They can continue forward with academic studies, or they can abandon academics and join the PSMA as an officer candidate.  This decision is made by the student, not their parents or guardians, and interfering with the student's right to choose leads to civil and criminal penalties.<n/><n/>The UPL would tempt students to join the PSMA with promises of glory and elevated status within society (there is no station in society that is more 'elite' than UPL officers, including ultra-rich or otherwise famous civilians).  Gideon was chosen for Operation Backswing due to his familiarity with the area.  He had used this region as a staging area to build up UPL forces in secret before striking at a rebellion in Boston Massachusetts, a two hour hop by Osprey.  The attempt to quash the rebellion failed disasterously, as a UPL analyst was discovered to be an informant working for the rebels, and he had to abandon what equipment was in the region to preserve what personnel he was able to save from the slaughter.<n/><n/>Gideon benefitted from the paradigm of 'Failing Upward,' and was promoted for bravery and for saving the soldiers he did.  A similar failure from an enlisted soldier or a civilian business manager in their respective duties would likely lead to a death sentence.

UserData/Lore/M07-ParticleBeams_Description=Despite the year being 2247, weaponry had not advanced significantly from kinetics, explosives, and projectile fire for the past two centuries.  While energy weapons are considerably cheaper to utilize vs the conventional weapon types (a cannon firing a charged particle beam costs a credit whereas an explosive one ton shell costs tens of thousands of credits).  The issue rests with overheating due to the portable nature of the devices.  Warships wielding particle beam weapons had to dedicate such enormous amounts of space to heat sinks and other heat dissipation measures that it was unable to support all of the needed crew, required additional propulsion systems to carry the additional weight, or was slower than optimal in the field due to the extra load.<n/><n/>The heat dissipates from these weapons in one of three methods, convection, radiation, or conduction.  Convection (transferring heat through a fluid via molecular motion) was not practical in this application, Radiation (releasing heat from the pbeam weapons into the surrounding air as particles), and the chosen method Conduction (Transferring heat from the weapons to water tanks and dense heat absorbing columns).  Radiation was not fast enough to dissipate the heat and the weight of the conduction materials made that option impractical as well.<n/><n/>The special ops unit and Colonel Gideon possess experimental particle beam weapons which have person-portable heat dissipation units in each of the soldiers' packs.  The dissipation comes at a cost however.  While it radiates the heat quickly in combination with heat absorption material in the pack and body armor, the radiation is lethal to the soldiers at that close proximity.  Gideon and his team are aware that the mission is a suicide run for them, whether or not it results in success.

UserData/Lore/M08-Calm_Description=While many of the combat personnel who were pressed into service were paralyzed with fear on the battlefield or ended up being deserters, regulars and commanders were generally calm in the face of certain death, and approached it as much as a byproduct of their duty as well as an inevitable extinction event for humankind.  Once it became clear that the war itself would invariably be lost, the choice became to duck and hide, or fight until the end.  With the families of many military leaders having either been killed or thrown out of contact with Defense Net, it became a matter of pride to stick it out through the end.<n/><n/>There was also a fear of what happens when soldiers are captured by the roaches and not killed, as roach egg farms were becoming more and more prevalent as the roaches continued to multiply with impunity.  Leaders preferred to die on their own terms, if death was ensured either way.<n/><n/>One of the remaining Defense Net analysts had begun keeping a scoreboard on behalf of leadership, tracking how many roaches they individually killed before they fell in any given battle.  While no senior officers officially affirmed or denied their participation in this exercise, the scoreboard was accessed dozens of times daily from base sites around the world, with fewer and fewer queries with each passing day.

UserData/Lore/M08-OP_Description=The UPL had foregone total nuclear commitment in a desire to avoid decimating the world's surface for decades to come, and in wanting to avoid needless killing of what was likely millions of refugees hiding in remote areas or in subsurface bunkers that were not sufficiently hardened against radiation.  The UPL Ruling Council, along with Admiral Hayes, determined that it was best to first evacuate the people we could from earth, and then unleash complete nuclear bombardment on every continent.  Operation Wounded Arrow is just that, the last major conventional stand against the roaches in which all operators and remaining command personnel were gathered to protect colony ships set to exfil from earth entirely.<n/><n/>Part of Wounded Arrow included tactical use of low orbit satellite weapons (which the roaches had largely ignored in the invasion as the UPL had remotely turned many 'off' to have them play dead).  These satellites would be crucial to attack any roach screamers or other creatures that detected the colony ships and attempted to follow them.  Equipped with particle beam cannons and anti-satellite missiles, the satellites could either destroy the roaches in tow or distract them long enough for the colony ships to accelerate to maximum sublight speeds of .10 the speed of light.<n/><n/>This did not prevent the UPL from utilizing nuclear attacks strategically however, launching missiles against the largest roach nests near the evacuation sites, with enough distance that the colony ships would be able to launch before the effect of radiation reached the city walls.

UserData/Lore/M08-Preppers_Description=When the roaches descended, it vindicated the worst fears of various corners of society including those who practiced religion in secret and dreaded the coming apocalypse (even though the UPL banned religion globally) as well as those who gathered food and supplies for some doomsday event.  While most people hording years of stores expected a solar event or an asteroid impact, the roach invasion served a similar purpose.  Lastly, rogue elements and dissidents used chaos from the invasion to break into UPL manufacturing plants and vehicle yards to steal weapons of war, establishing remote bases of operation from which they would stage a takeover of the world following the extinction event.  <n/><n/>Once the UPL lost more than half of its operators in the first week of the attacks, the global military had far more equipment than qualified personnel to drive/fly them and taking inventory of massive reservoirs of assets was at the bottom of Admiral Hayes' priority list.  This made it even easier for dissidents to take armaments and vanish.  One such group took up residence in this cavern system, Commander.  And just as Defense Net detected the anomalous radiation signature in the cave, the roaches had as well.  Radiation appears to aid the roaches in various mutations in their established evolution chains, and it is now a race to find what is likely nuclear ordinance that the preppers in this cave had taken.

UserData/Lore/M09-Roaches_Description=Humanity's first large scale encounters with the zerg occurred when the creatures first landed on earth, with their resilience to biological toxins, small arms fire, and nerve agents reminding UPL soldiers of cockroaches.  Just as cockroaches have been shown to survive exposure to insecticides, poison, being cooked in a vapor box or being frozen and thawed and still alive, the invading creatures have shown similar durability.  As more and more soldiers referenced fighting the zerg to be like fighting cockroaches, eventually that was shortened and the moniker 'roaches' was formally adopted.<n/><n/>The UPL further defined these 'roach' structures and creatures based on their apparent function or physical characteristics, such as referring to zerglings as rodents due to them being smaller sized pests on the battlefield, tunnelers which refer to the nydus canals, or spikers which refer to Slohr's lurker type creature.  Sometimes humans get it wrong, such as referring to hydralisks as 'spitters' even though the creatures are hurling spikes from their appendages and not actually spitting them.<n/><n/>There was significant debate within the military as to whether forces could openly communicate with one another or would still follow the standard practice of concealing locations and targets with codenames.  A better safe than sorry approach was adopted, but the truth of the matter is Slohr does not need to monitor communications at all.  If intelligence is sought, the best source is to infest humans and derive all the information that is required from their memories.

UserData/Lore/M09-Ships_Description=Within one hour of the zerg's arrival on earth, the UPL began prepping a doomsday evacuation scenario in case operations were not successful in repelling the invader.  Hundreds of ships capable of sub-light interstellar travel were prepped in launch facilities around the world, each capable of holding hundreds of humans in a stasis that would slow the aging process and allow a person to exist in a state of dormancy for centuries, long enough for the ships to find a new world upon which to settle.  The ships were also packed to the brim with construction materials for new settlements, seeds for easy agricultural setup, and survey equipment.<n/><n/>At the same time, individuals on the UPL's VIP list were all summoned to report to the Everest Complex as they had been chosen to be the future colonists.  This includes the police officer A.U.D. 36 who was rescued by Officer Myra Davis at the outset of the invasion, and who is on this ship.  Slohr's assessment of the ships is correct.  Within each is biomass waiting to be infused into its brood, which in turn will rapidly repopulate following worldwide use of nuclear ordinance against the roaches.<n/><n/>Slohr forbade its brood from destroying any of the colony ships (in flight or on the ground), such that the humans onboard could be harvested.

UserData/Lore/M09-Slohr_Description=The ruling intelligence of the Zerg in 2247, the Overmind, had grown well beyond the limits originally intended by its Xel'Naga creator, Amon.  Amon had created the Overmind to fulfill its vision of creating 'perfect' entities, those containing both purity of essence (Zerg) and purity of form (Protoss), which would involve the destruction of both species and refashion creation in Amon's image.  Though not a mindless slave, the Overmind was under Amon's thrall and could not resist.  It was only a matter of time before the other Xel'Naga learned of Amon's plan.  <n/><n/>When the Xel'Naga attempted to intervene, Amon ordered the Overmind to attack the Xel'Naga worldships in orbit of the zerg homeworld, Zerus.  Hundreds of ships were destroyed and the Overmind absorbed the essence of thousands of Xel'Naga into itself.  While Amon was still defeated, the Overmind remained bound to the will of its creator, and continued in its quest to find the Protoss to fulfill the plan Amon had set in motion.  The Overmind was then considerably more powerful as a result of the Xel'Naga essence it absorbed.  Its power was such that it could control its swarm over galactic distances, and it used this to its advantage.<n/><n/>The Overmind dispatched its lieutenants...its cerebrates, across space to find the Protoss.  Slohr is one of these cerebrates, and it moved tens of thousands of light years through warp rifts, well away from the bulk of the Overmind's primary swarm.  While Slohr has not yet located the Protoss, it was successful in its integration of other species into its own brood that were found on various worlds.  Slohr's brood is what has invaded the earth.  The Overmind's focus is on the search for the Protoss, or any creatures with psionic potential, and earth has neither, so Slohr has been left to manage its brood autonomously.  <n/><n/>The sociopath Doran Routhe had rounded up any humans who, through gene splicing or cybernetic enhancement showed the slightest signs of telepathy and other extra sensory potential, and placed them among others on the four supercarriers sent to Gantris IV but which crashed in the Koprulu Sector.<n/><n/>It was the descendants of these humans in the Koprulu Sector in 2500 (250 years after the earth invasion) which demonstrated tremendous psionic potential to the Overmind.<n/><n/>By the time Slohr arrived on earth, the population had been purged of its psionic potential, leaving Slohr's attack to be one purely designed to bolster the strength of its brood before moving forward with its own search for the Protoss.
UserData/Lore/M09-Slohr_Title=Slohr
UserData/Lore/M09-TheBrood_Description=With earth being tens of thousands of light years away from the primary zerg swarm and the Overmind, the cerebrate Slohr and its brood on earth were cut off from the Zerg's Evolution Master, Abathur.  The Overmind could still control and support Slohr to a degree, but the distance prevented any other creatures in the swarm from directly intervening on Slohr's behalf.  Due to the absence of a structured system of evolution governance, Slohr was required to spin threads of different species together on its own to improve the brood's capabilities.<n/><n/>Slohr was particularly interested in creating powerful variants of various species such as Hydralisks and Ultralisks, however for every success Slohr had in this regard, hundreds of failed attempts and liquified biomass also occurred.  It's for this reason that Slohr's champions are limited in number, and it is a fortuitous limitation for earth's defenders, already on the verge of defeat, that more of these powerful 'champion' breeds were not birthed.  <n/><n/>While most of Slohr's brood is similar in species composition as the Overmind's swarms, Slohr has been able to advance certain life forms it discovered on other worlds before coming to earth, resulting in some differences as well.  <n/><n/>Slohr also took notice of the soft rock that comprised earth's crust (similar in composition to andesite).  This allowed Slohr to spin strands and provide its brood with the universal ability to move while burrowed across earth's landmasses, unlike the denser planetary crusts in the Koprulu Sector which only specialized zerg breeds could move through freely.  With Slohr's burrowing evolution, its brood had the ability to move below ground when attacking most objectives, allowing the creatures to bypass many of the UPL's perimeter defenses.

UserData/Lore/M10-Desertions_Description=Though the invasion had barely been in play for a month, the United Powers League had endured disastrous defeat after disastrous defeat.  The UPL military initially deployed with hopeful sentiment toward driving back the aliens but as the days wore on, and soldiers died by the millions, the hope converted to despair and the UPL was losing one soldier to desertion for every soldier who was killed in action.<n/><n/>The UPL utilized two measures in an attempt to curb these events.  The first was institution of a planetary draft to fill the lines, though it only exacerbated the issue as the new soldiers were often half-trained inexperienced civilians.  They were as much a liability on the field as poor terrain choices for engagements.  One might think that humans would line up to fight the roaches in droves without a draft being required given the need to defend our planet.  Due to the continuous string of losses and unbelievable casualties, most people turned their eyes toward escaping with their families and hiding in a remote location in lieu of serving on the line, which was akin to a death sentence.  This accounted for rapidly increasing desertions, with thousands disappearing from the ranks daily.<n/><n/>The other measure involved the required re-enlistment of all retired military service people as well as the federalizing of all regional law enforcement globally.  The UPL pulled all forces from the borders of the separatist nations to combat the roaches as well, leaving the separatist nations with only their militias to protect them.  Those countries were devoured by the roaches within days of the roaches' arrival.
UserData/Lore/M10-Desertions_Title=Desertions
UserData/Lore/M10-EggFarms_Description=A fate worse than death or a living nightmare are how people around the world referred to the roach egg farms.  By this time in the war, all people knew about the eggs, and how the roaches reproduced.  Apparently, the biomass material of humans was of little use to the roaches if dead; decomposers had already broken down some of the corpse's available nutrients into elementary substances, making it far less efficient for roach incubation.  Roaches thus mostly fed directly on dead humans.<n/><n/>But for reproduction in the brood, it was living people who were placed in the nests and gradually consumed by larva as they first encased humans inside of egg sacs, and then dissolved them over a period of hours.  The liquid inside the egg sacs was adapted to earth's atmosphere and was oxygenated, to allow people to breathe despite being trapped in the viscous material.<n/><n/>For soldiers who heard the screams of people trapped inside the eggs across deserted valleys or in abandoned cities, there was no sleeping through that.  And what courage they could muster to stand against the roaches was marred by the fear that they too would be captured, and not simply killed on the battlefield.  Tallies for desertion skyrocketed once knowledge of the egg farms became commonplace.

UserData/Lore/M10-SETI_Description=S.E.T.I. (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) evolved into a global military organization following the formation of the United Powers League.  All member nations are required to provide a percentage of their gross domestic product to support SETI and SETI work can only be performed by UPL active duty personnel with clearance Olive or higher.<n/><n/>SETI broadcast arrays are located in the United States, Russia, and Australia with other nations providing data analysis, equipment fabrication, maintenance personnel, and satellite support nodes.  Once the Everest Complex dropped from the UPL Command Net, nations were cut off from centralized coordinated enemy repulsion efforts and they became self-reliant in their efforts to repulse the alien invasion.  In the case of the United States, it was determined that it would move forward with completing Operation Torch, which required consolidation of military resources around the remaining SETI facilities in California.  In the case of the campus in Mountain View, this acts as a mission control of sorts for the California arrays, monitoring equipment status and operating the dishes.

UserData/Lore/M10-Scotland_Description=The roaches have taken over more than 95% of the earth's land mass, with 100% uncontested control projected within the next 72 hours.  And part of the area not yet controlled by the roaches were the Scottish Highlands.  Scotland undertook an experiment to poison the land around the highlands, rendering it lifeless, and also pouring toxins into the water along the shorelines (leaving freshwater reservoirs on the Highlands untouched).  The roaches bypassed these areas when encountering them, thinking the entire interior to be dead as well, and moved on to their invasion of Britain and the UPL's European Consortium. <n/><n/>The UPL ultimately disregarded the tactic as useless since it only forestalled the inevitable; the roaches would eventually discover the oasis inside the ring of soured land around the Highlands.  Scotland got a pass early in the invasion.  The Scots did not hide from the battles that occurred worldwide over the past few weeks.  In fact it's the opposite, with every able bodied person aged 16 to 60 joining Operation Elpis.  For those who stayed behind, they spent the past three weeks carving out extensive subterranean networks which could be used as large scale doomsday bunkers, hundreds of feet below the habitable surface and away from the prying olfactory of roach scouts.  <n/><n/>While the roaches would eventually discover the Highlands, Scotland's population was able to successfully move underground, leaving the roaches nothing more than trees and meadows.  Massive springs were located in the newly dug caverns, and would keep survivors alive for decades.

UserData/Lore/P02P2-Sewer System_Description=Although referred to as sewers, the underground water canals are actually streets of '<c val="FFFF00">Old Odessa</c>' that were flooded a century ago.  The regional governance board opted to build the new city on top of the ruins instead of demolishing the remnants and laying new foundations.<n/><n/>The sewers are neither efficient nor sewers by proper definition, as the water and wastewater is left standing until such time as levels rise high enough that it will be emptied into the ocean.  To combat what would become an unbearable odor in the city above, the UPL installed a local chemical dispersal system which injects <c val="FFFF00">ammonia</c> among other compounds into the standing water to neutralize the smell.  In short, all of the waste, none of the down side, unless you're standing in it.

UserData/Lore/Tau Ceti_Description=With a population just north of 20,000 colonists, Tau Ceti is among five off-earth settlements of the United Powers League, the others being the Centauri Colonies, and research facilities on Pluto, Jupiter's Moon Europa, and the asteroid Ganymede.  Tau Ceti (in the constellation Cetus) is a series of linked large asteroids with most of the facilities being underground to shelter colonists from what is otherwise lethal radiation (no atmosphere).<n/><n/>The Tau Ceti planetoids orbit a single G-Class main sequence star which has ~85% the mass of earth's sun.  The colony is able to subsist despite the enormous costs of resupply through its comet farms.  Because Tau Ceti had several planets that never fully formed, there is a substantial increased presence of comets and the aforementioned asteroids in the system.  Those comets contain materials that cannot be acquired in the Sol system and are very useful in cryogenics and long haul space travel.  Nearly 90% of the colony's income is drawn from these comet farm operations.<n/><n/>Because the minerals and resources in the Tau Ceti system are so valuable, there is a substantial military force deployed there which is supplemented with guns-for-hire mercenaries.  The Tau Ceti colonists have a saying, "We don't want to know," which means that as long as you don't tell the colonists about your shady activities, criminal past, or who you're running from, they don't much care as long as you tow your weight.  This makes it an ideal refuge for Doran Routhe, the scientist responsible for the death of hundreds of millions on earth.  Routhe, having lost UPL protection, is the primary target of every bounty hunter between earth and Pluto.

UserData/Lore/Trams_Description=When Tau Ceti was first founded, there were limited aerial support vehicles on hand and prolonged exposure to solar radiation was lethal (even with protective suits) when walking from one side of a planetoid to another.  The tram systems were deployed to mitigate this risk, transiting colonists long distance via an underground tube system.  As the colony thrived, more and more ships were stationed there (military and civilian), eliminating the need for the tram system.  Digging into the asteroids was time consuming and costly, and eventually the tram system was abandoned.<n/><n/>The trams are in good working order however, so with power restored, they are good as new.
