Conversation/EP01M01/Group00009=Victory
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00001=Lieutenant Rand, I have a status report; I see no indication of hostile presences.  Neither motion nor biological signatures register on my sensors.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00002=You see any bodies?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00003=Negative Sergeant Peters, although my sensors do detect extensive instances of blood spatter.  Due to malfunctioning heating systems in this installation, this room has cooled to near 0 degrees Celsius.  It is not possible for me to approximate the time of the blood-
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00004=Copy that.  CARR engage sentry protocol, we're right behind you.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00005=Sentry protocol engaged, Sergeant Peters.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00006=Corporal, what we lookin at?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00007=Looks like pirates stripped the hell outta this place sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00008=Ground transports are wasted.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00009=The walls in this place are built to deflect cosmic rays so thermo-imaging...is a bust.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00010=Okay so we're blind, that doesn't mean we're deaf.  Sweep the comm channels, Burns.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00011=No chatter sir, nothing.  No pirates, no research staff, no one's talkin...no one's squawkin.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00012=CARR, in the event of a pirate attack, where would the colonists go to ground?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00013=A review of the most recent draft of the blueprints for this installation show there is an evacuation bunker approximately eighty meters below the surface.  This bunker is specifically designed to protect the colonists against a terminal ballistic event, or-
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00014=Yes sir!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00015=You heard the man!  Move your asses!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00016=Just moved through one of the quarantine zones, sir.  Some of the equipment's still on-line.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00017=Confirmed, Corporal.  I'll have one of the pencil necks check it out.  Keep movin.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00018=Sir, we've found large breaches in the interior structure.  Based on the look of the damage, I think pirates used some form of carbon scoring to burn their way through the bulkheads.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00019=LT, I think we've got something here.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00020=A body?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00021=I...I don't really know how to describe it sir.  It looks like some kind of really weird mutant cockroach.  It's freakin huge!  What do you want us to do with it?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00022=Just keep it contained, I'm movin up.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00023=Roger that.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00024=Alright Corporal, what do you think you've found up here?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00025=Now I am hearin' something. We getting anything on the thermo-imagers yet?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00026=Thermals are still useless sir.  And I'm not picking up any motion...besides us.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00027=What about you, Reynolds?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00028=Getting a whole lot of nothin back here too, sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00029=Alert, biohazard detected.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00030=It... it's moving toward us sir... it's moving toward us!  Holy crap!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00031=Nail it, now!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00032=Alright people.  You find anything in this place that ain't human, you kill it.  We're movin' to the bunker.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00033=Corporal, put what's left of that 'thing' in a jar for the trip home.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00034=Yes sir!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00035=You there, private, you got the duty.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00036=Lieutenant Rand, I have successfully isolated the communications frequency needed to contact Warrant Officer Hobbes.  He indicates he has been attempting to contact you for the past five minutes, sir.  Please stand by for a comm patch.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00037=...I'm seeing a lot of movement on the ground near the complex, sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00038=If anyone's alive, that's where they'll be, move out!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00039=I can barely read you; got all kinds of lead in the walls.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00040=A whole bunch of... I don't know what just came out of the ice and they're on your six.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00041=Roger that.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00042=New plan boys, we're gonna detour at the next junction, make for the back door, evac, and come back with enough firepower to put a hole in this moon.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00043=You heard the man!  We're heading to evac zone Bravo!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00044=Alright, there it is!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00045=Door's locked, dammit!  LT!  We need an engineer up here now, sir!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00046=CARR, I want you and what's left of the incinerators at the junction.  Just keep those bastards out of the LT's face til the door's down!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00047=Just a bit longer people!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00048=May day, may day, may day!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00049=They just took out the Condor!  We need to fall back, now!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00050=Partial power failure. Damage has been sustained by one or more solar arrays.  Emergency lighting activated.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00051=Sergeant Peters, I am truly sorry for your losses.  However, mission parameters require us to move forward sir.  Without power, the elevator system will no longer function.  We cannot return to the upper-
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00052=I'm gonna kill every one of these sons of bitches!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00053=Sir, as part of the early warning system, any deep space reconnaissance team must communicate anomalous findings to the UPL Central Command Hub.  According to the installation's blueprints, there is a communication interface on this level.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00054=We have no effing power!  The grid's been fried!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00055=Sir, my internal systems can be configured to both interface with and channel energy to the communication equipment. I will be rendered permanently non-functional afterward as my memory core will not survive the heat generated by the energy conversion.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00056=We'll get you to the comm room. You get the word out. That's the deal.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00057=Give'em hell!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00058=It has been a pleasure serving with you sir.  I am initiating comm mode now and will broadcast the warning once my core reboots and fully charges.  I require approximately sixty seconds for that to process sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00059=You just make sure I don't die on a failed op.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00060=Of course, sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00061=Alright you sons-of-bitches, let's dance.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00062=Our whole team just got wiped!  We've got no power!  Those things just wasted our evac!  What's left to do huh?  Freeze to death?  Run out of air? 
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00063=This is Doctor Ben Melrose, the time is 22:51 earth standard, the day is September 28, 2248. This is Lazarus log seventeen. To recap progress so far, we found the culprit and hats off to Mr. Radek who caught the thing. It's been chewing up cabling to our solar panels for the last two days.  It is absolutely an extrasolar complex organism and yes, it...it appears to be ammonia based. I'm not sure how the physiology addresses the heat evaporation issue. I'm not sure yet that is.<n/><n/>Subject Lazarus zero one is docile, expressing no apparent recognition of its current environment or of us. More to come tomorrow. Night folks.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00064=This is Doctor Ben Melrose, the time is 18:14 earth standard, the day is September 27, 2248. This is Lazarus log ten. The subject's auto-immune system successfully neutralized hydrogen cyanide.  It appears that it does not require electrons to be transported from Cytochrome C to oxygen, or it is able to effect aerobic respiration in some other fashion.  I still can't express my absolute amazement at the near invulnerability of this creature's cells.  Our next experiment will involve exposure to nerve agents under Axis-6 protocol.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00065=This is Doctor Ben Melrose, the time is 23:42 earth standard, the day is September 28, 2248. This is Lazarus log twenty-three. Kate dragged me back down here and said the thing was going bananas.  Containment protocols are in place and there appears to be no risk of a breach.  The thing just keeps bashing its head against the wall.  And that's impact drill number five this month so it looks like this log entry's being cut short.  Not sure what's going on with all the drills this month but- Kate can you check on that yelling in the lab?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00066=This is Lab Assistant Katherine Jacobs. Dr. Melrose is dead!  They're killing everyone! Lazarus...is not alone...
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00067=Lieutenant Rand, all clinical measurements for Technician Adams have flat lined sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00068=Lieutenant Rand, all clinical measurements for Technician Adams have flat lined sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00069=That's all the audio I can squeeze out of this thing's local drive, sir. The rest of the files are probably on the servers and...those are offline.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00070=I got a bit more off this terminal's local drive. In addition to the audio, it's some kind of test results I think.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00071=And?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00072=Um, Sergeant I'm not that kind of tech. I can't make heads or tails out of the biological data, but I've uploaded it remote to CARR for the trip home.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00073=None of the data retrieved thus far indicates the installation's employees had more than one of these organisms in containment.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00074=Cut the chatter dammit!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00075=Um...sir, if there's been a xenomorphic event we need to go...now...right now!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00076=You don't leave until we leave. And we don't leave until we finish our sweep. I bet your company paid you triple time to take this duty. Doesn't seem worth it now does it?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00077=The loss of power prevented station personnel from executing a coolant flush.  Stagnant coolant is naturally corrosive and appears to have leaked from pipes in various locations as a result.  Use caution Lieutenant Rand; military combat suits and my polymer skeleton are not able to withstand long-term exposure.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00078=Bates just did inventory. It looks like we left the flashlight assemblies back home. Guess the UPL was freakin out about this place and just put us in the slingshot without checking the supplies.  We've still got our infrared, thermal imagers, motion sensors, and flares sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00079=We've got an intact screen here folks!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00080=Auto-defenses! Melt'em down!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00081=Civvie assclowns!  Didn't bother turning off the auto-D in case someone actually responded to their SOS!  CARR can you help with this?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00082=I apologize Private McMahon, I am unable to establish a connection with the host system to disable this installation's defenses.  External connections to the installation's mainframe must be damaged.  The defenses will need to be destroyed.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00083=Oh that's great, yeah just great...thanks!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00084=Sure would be nice to have the big guy up here to give us some cover instead of hanging back with the LT in the hangar, don't ya think?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00085=Lieutenant Rand, I am detecting an audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement-
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00086=No joke. I heard it too.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00087=LT...no comms, no bodies, these weird ass noises.  I can't sound the all clear sir.  I'll take a squad up and report back physically.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00088=You there, pencil neck!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00089=That's right, you. Let's go.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00090=Anyone else notice there's no blood down here?  Nothing blown up...Weird right?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00091=I bet what happened is that thing they had locked up in here, got loose and everyone went bat shit crazy!  There's no pirates.  There never were.  Burns, you're up, take a squad to the next level and get a head start while we finish up here.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00092=That's three!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00093=You, uh, you hear that sir?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00094=Hear what, Corporal?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00095=The frequency, wavelength, and amplitude of this sound is similar to the sound I detected earlier.  I have been unable to match it to any audio profile contained in my onboard database.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00096=LT, one down sir, one to go.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00097=Auxiliary Power Restored
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00098=The solar cells are at full charge so we've got power. Just had to reroute some of the circuits while I was waltzing with the system here. Life support's still offline so don't take off the suit just yet.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00099=Pencil neck, you're up!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00100=Here come some more, sir!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00101=They're comin' up out of the grills!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00102=Shit, they're behind us!  A whole shitload of these things just came up our arse!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00103=LT we're getting folded up pretty bad here.  We need support or we need to fall back!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00104=I've got more of those things sighted sir!  We need backup!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00105=LT, Charlie Squad just found the quarantine chamber and they say it's intact sir.  The lab windows are fogged to shit! They can't see what's in there but they said the incinerator control console's still active.  The techs are recommending we do a flame purge, over.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00106=Danger.  Purge cycle initiated in quarantine unit.  Evacuate BSL 4 laboratory immediately.  Purge to commence in ten seconds.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00107=Initiating BXD Flame Suppression
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00108=It's party time boys!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00109=What the hell are these things?!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00110=Holy shit, these things are everywhere!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00111=Keep your cool, Corporal!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00112=Light 'em up!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00113=Lieutenant Rand. An assessment of our current situation indicates a tactical deficiency. I recommend moving to the adjacent corridor. It will allow you to funnel the alien organisms into a smaller space.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00114=Move up! Now! Move!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00115=Lieutenant Rand. Impacts from ballistic weapon fire have ruptured the power converter's fuel cells. We will need to move to the auxiliary generators to restore facility lighting sir.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00116=These things don't show up on infrared and they're not pinging on the motion checks!  Who's got the effing flares?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00117=Burns had'em!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00118=I have modified some of my ordinance to provide illumination. It will take me approximately one minute to prepare another round.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00119=Just keep the light burning CARR.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00120=CARR just lit the next safe zone.  Move!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00121=I am attempting to isolate the aliens' bio-electrical signatures for use with your HUDs so you can detect them even in the absence of light. Please stand by.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00122=Lieutenant Rand, I have isolated the bio-electrical signatures of the alien organisms. I am now able to track their movements.  As long as I remain functional, I will provide grid references for all active HUDs.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00123=Hobbes, you copy?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00124=Lieutenant I can barely read you.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00125=We're almost at the back door.  Reposition for pickup, we're comin to ya.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00126=Sergeant Peters, while this is not a military facility, the United Powers League insisted that all deep space outposts have at least one Z-1 Battle Suit on standby in the event of a pirate attack. It appears this facility's personnel were not able to reach this Z-1 armor suit before the complex was overrun. Based on my initial scans, the suit and its energy core are fully functional.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00127=On our way, Corporal.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00128=Eat this!
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00129=This is the communication interface and there is a live connection to the installation's exterior dish.
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00130=Commander! LT! we thought you were dead, hell we thought we were dead, all the power took a dump about 15 minutes ago, we got trapped between bulkheads. Reynolds and the rest of our squad were killed in an ambush, so it's just us left. What are your orders?
Conversation/EP01M01/Line00160=Outpost four ninety-seven is minimally equipped.  We have air dropped raw materials for fabrication of key facilities and armor and weapons for new troops.  You will need to use the headquarters building to manufacture mining drones, and command them to harvest the nearby materials.

Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00027=This is A.U.D. 195, moving to 442's location.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00028=All officers, there is a possible 10-00 at 8826 Rochester Street, Connelly Apartments.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00029=This is A.U.D. 219, responding.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00030=This is A.U.D. 226, responding.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00031=What the heck is goin' on here?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00032=I don't know what the hell's going on out here!  These things are attacking anything that moves. There's a lot of'em and tranqs do not work!  Use live ammo!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00033=Confirmed, tranquilizers are ineffective.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00034=All officers use live ammunitions for all 10-90Vs. Repeat, all 10-90Vs are considered code red.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00035=Dispatch, we got dogs outside in these peoples' yard, confirm the kill order!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00036=All officers, 10-90Vs only, over.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00037=...
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00038=A.U.D. 85, advise of situation.

Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00040=A.U.D. 85, advise of situation, over!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00041=This is A.U.D. 109! We got freak job wild animals everywhere out here! Officer needs help!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00042=All officers, 10-50 at fourteen 7th street, respond.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00043=Anyone else feeling a gas station isn't the best place for a firefight?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00044=This is A.U.D. 24, I've got 10-91Vs just outside East Rochester on Mason. We're gonna need a SWAT prep, over.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00045=All officers, be advised that a TAC alert has been declared. SWAT has been notified to airlift.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00046=Fall back!  Fall back!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00047=Commander, looks like the first riot group's here to reinforce us.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00048=Oh, you called'em out here?  I hope you have a few more rabbits to pull out of your ass!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00049=Alright, spill it.  You get the special ops briefs.  What the hell's going on?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00050=Okay, get this.  No one knows anything.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00051=No one has any idea where these things came from?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00052=Oh yeah, yeah, I almost forgot.  No, no one has any idea.  I guess that's getting old.  Okay, really no one knows anything, not regional command, and I'd say not Defense Net but they're clueless anytime defecation hits the oscillation around here.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00053=Unbelievable!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00054=So what's up with regional command anyway?  They sending help anytime soon? 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00055=I think we're forty-fifth on the list.  They'll be sending troops to the larger cities first.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00056=These things are hitting other areas?  You could have told me that earlier when I asked, ya know.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00057=You can grouse at me later if we live.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00058=Alright, I just got something on special ops comms.  You're gonna love this.  You know how we're patrolling around the city making sure folks don't go outside right now? 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00059=Yeah. Half of them aren't listening 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00060=And the other half think it's UPL propaganda. These creatures haven't hit neighborhoods outside the city yet, or the city's south side.  The people there don't believe any of this is real. 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00061=What? I mean, I suppose I don't blame 'em.  We've had three regional quarantines in the past year. 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00062=HQ's worried all these people are gonna get ornery.  They're already setting up protests in the green zones.  
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00063=We've got to broadcast some vids or something so they don't get themselves killed.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00064=UPL shuttered all the networks in the region, Myra.  Standard protocol.  They want one version of things guiding the population.  
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00065=Great...then I guess we'll just have to save their asses after they see a few slimy things with claws and sharp teeth.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00066=This is A.U.D. 499, a couple of us are a block from HQ near the foreign language cinema complex and a bunch of these things just ran inside. A little help might be nice, just sayin.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00067=A.U.D. Two niner eight responding.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00068=Denise is in trouble, Commander!  Do you need an engraved invitation or what?!  Let's haul it!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00069=Hey Denise.  We got here as quick as we could.  Is this everyone?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00070=Hey Myra.  HQ mobilized the entire force in the field, so yeah, this what we've got.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00071=What happened to the other officers who acknowledged your SOS?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00072=You're the first one to actually get here, and Commander, well, well, well, I'm surprised to see you monitoring things at ground level.  Slummin it with the grunts, huh?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00073=The Commander's got us covered.  Trust me.  Is your family okay?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00074=Yeah, Dan and Caleb came down to HQ when they saw one of those mutant dogs knock over our trash cans, before the real mess started.  And what about you-
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00075=I'm actually glad in this case that's not something I need to worry about.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00076=They're chasing civilians out of the theater!  Waste those bastards!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00077=Sounds like the UPL's doing some flybys.  Hopefully that means they'll be sending in the cavalry soon.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00078=That's it for me, Myra.  HQ's got me on another assignment now.  Watch your back out there.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00079=That's what the Commander's for.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00080=Seven officers, including me, are moving to evidence storage for body armor and automatic weapons.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00081=That's just great.  The UPL's put our resident Infernal Repairs desk jockey on the VIP list.  Let's get him back to HQ and get this over with.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00082=This is an emergency message from the United Powers League regional news network. All affiliate stations have been placed under federal authority during the current crisis. All citizens are instructed to stay off roadways, remain inside, and lock your doors. We will broadcast updates when safe zones and shelters are identified. Repeat, all citizens not actively involved in containment operations are required to stay off the roadways and remain indoors until further notice.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00083=Hey there Hank.  The Commander and I are here to escort you back to HQ, but don't think for a second we're dying for you.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00084=Yeah, that's it.  Keep rolling your eyes like that and you might find a brain back there.  Let's go.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00085=We need a cordon from 1st and Rochester! 10-91 victors have overrun our checkpoint on the river front, over!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00086=I agree, Commander.  If these things are taking over the River Walk, we need to get down there and secure the hydroelectric power station before it's overrun.  The whole grid's probably already on its way to being fried.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00087=We'll need to take a city engineer to make sure the power's redirected properly before we collapse the entrance.  You round up the engineer, I'll commandeer a SWAT van and a few officers from HQ.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00088=Those things are jumping out of the sewage!  We need to keep'em off the engineer, Commander!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00089=We need heavy armor at Mandarin for cover!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00090=We've got one riot transport being fueled at the evidence storage garage.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00091=Good, bring it!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00092=This is an emergency message from the United Powers League regional news network. The shelters at the McCallister complex and the Odessa police headquarters are still receiving intake. The shelter at Lorne Street and 4th is full and cannot house additional civilians. The shelter at the R Street stadium is considered unsafe and citizens are advised to seek alternatives. There is no contact with the shelter at the Dunst tunnel East barricade, citizens are advised to seek alternatives. If you are unable to reach a designated shelter, you are instructed to stay inside and lock your doors.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00093=Come on people!  Move your asses!  We are out of time!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00094=We need SWAT at Hillside and Forrest, now!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00095=Alright, that's not a bad idea.  Yeah, it could work.  Okay, let's bring it near one of the fuel trucks, set it off, and see what happens.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00096=Yes!  That tore a hole right in its...whatever that part of its body is.  We've got a few more trucks left, so let's make them count!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00097=Dead and dead!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00098=I've got 1091-Vs the size of houses out here!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00099=What's the location?!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00100=Broadway and Lexmark! They're tearing through our cordon like it's tin foil!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00101=This is A.U.D. 57, stay clear of 14th and Red River.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00102=The aliens have overrun the Ring Line! All officers fall back to Point K Route 246!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00103=Multiple officers down, multiple officers down! Where's the riot group, over?!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00104=I have no words.  You have any ideas, Commander?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00105=Sergeant do you have any idea what's going on?  What the hell are these things?!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00106=No one's got a clue, Davis!  The Captain sure as hell don't. The last word we got from dispatch was to rally here, then all the comms went dead.    
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00107=These sons of bitches are as tough as cockroaches.  No matter what we hit'em with, they get back up for more.  If they hit us again, we're gonna be in a world of hurt. 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00108=That grade four armor don't make a damn bit of difference, either.  Those Roach things carve through it like we're wearin t-shirts.  Tear gas doesn't work.  We are combat ineffective!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00109=We getting any SRTs out here?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00110=Most of our precinct's squad is right here.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00111=You're kidding right?  You're not kidding...then the UPL better haul ass and get more troops here.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00112=This is central dispatch, all personnel be advised, satcom is impaired and we have established a communication landlink, there should be no further interruptions.  We're receiving widespread reports of protests against the UPL stay-at-home order.  Civilians are gathering at the safe zones, out. 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00113=It's just monsters coming to eat their children.  Great reason to protest having to stay indoors.  Commander, if we don't contain this thing soon, there's gonna be a riot!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00114=Commander, these monsters are growing some weird fungus down the street.  The Captain thinks they're using it as their own base.  We can't have'em so close to HQ.  The UPL said they're loaning us some of those psycho incinerator guys.  Let's bring the barbecue to them!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00115=Alright folks, just got a call from the Mayor's office.  We need to haul ass over there and fold'em in for evac.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00116=Hey, stop, stop!  You're going the wrong way!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00117=The Mayor's our top priority, Davis.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00118=Sergeant!  We've got civvies running into a red zone, we need to head due south, now!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00119=We've got our own problems Davis, keep up with the convoy, or don't.  But we're picking up the Mayor no matter what you do, and then we're gone!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00120=They're running into a red zone!  They'll be dead without our help!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00121=Myra, this is nuts!  We can't save everybody!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00122=Those were women and children back there!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00123=Myra what the hell are you doin?  Without the convoy we'll get tore up out there.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00124=Fine.  You go save the wrinkly-ass money laundering politician.  I'll go save the women and children!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00125=The whole damn city's comin down on us Davis!  Keep up because we're not slowin down to watch out for you!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00126=What the hell are those things?!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00127=Damn, those big blimps carry the little roaches around.  Like helos or something.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00128=Ah shit!  Looks like a bunch more of those things are on their way to unload somewhere near the Mayor.  We need to take'em out before they get where they're goin!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00129=Alright that's the last of'em.  The Mayor's office is just a couple blocks down.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00130=Okaaaayyy.  So some of these blimp things got to the roof.  That means there's going to be a lot more of these critters coming down to meet us in the lobby.  Awesome.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00131=Commander, ten officers already went up there to get the Mayor, and none of'em have come back.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00132=I've been holding the lobby but more of those things keep probing around.  Stairs, elevators, outside, they're coming from all over the freakin place.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00133=That's them!  That's them!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00134=Commander those things are tearing up the gas mains!  They get any closer and this building's gonna go up like a bonfire!  There's no way to get to the Mayor, and more and more of these things are comin after us.  I'm getting the hell outta here.  The sergeant here can hold the lobby so you can go find him upstairs if you wanna die too.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00135=Commander, I'm taking one of the SWAT vans, and thanks.  I wouldn't leave the other one sitting out here too long.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00136=Ah, finally.  His excellency arrives.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00137=Are you okay, your honor?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00138=I'll be better if we can get to a safe zone officer, all things considered.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00139=Do you have enough room for everyone?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00140=As long as your guys don't mind lyin' on top of each other, your honor.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00141=Dammit, I knew these idiots were going to riot!  I knew it!  The road to the tunnel is totally blocked! Totally blocked!  The only way we're getting there is on foot.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00142=Stand behind me, your honor.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00143=Davis, we're bailing the hell out of here!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00144=Are they extraterrestrials sir?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00145=We have not ruled out that possibility.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00146=We're receiving reports that these creatures are appearing in urban centers worldwide.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00147=All active military forces in the affected areas are being mobilized.  We're also working with the UPL Council to federalize regional law enforcement pers-
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00148=*Groans*
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00149=Any officer respond?!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00150=This is A.U.D. 442 to dispatch, what is the rally point for TAC?  
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00151=There's a full riot group moving to Dessau and Congress in about five minutes.  I'm headin there now.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00152=Okay Commander, Sergeant, Corporal...looks like it's just us.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00153=Holy...these things have been here what, three hours?  And it already looks like they've been here for years.  I don't know what they've got growing here but we're taking it down.  All of it!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00154=Commander, that sounds like a great idea.  If the francine gas processing center is here, we'll create an explosion so powerful it will put these things in orbit.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00155=Aw, shit!  We've got more inbound!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00156=And from what the troops are telling me, the officer assigned to the UPL battalion was killed so Commander, looks like you're up.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00157=Commander, we understand you have taken tactical command of outpost four ninety-seven.  You are not properly trained in combat theater operations, so we are here to provide assistance.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00158=And in case you are not familiar with our purpose, the United Powers League Defense Net is a singular point of information processing and communication across all areas of combat command.  Said differently, we make sure the left hand knows what the right hand is up to, something very much necessary with standing forces deployed worldwide.  
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00159=Outpost four ninety-seven is minimally equipped.  We have air dropped raw materials for fabrication of key facilities and armor and weapons for new troops.  You will need to use the headquarters building to manufacture mining drones, and command them to harvest the nearby materials.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00160=Good work, Commander.  Now, the Billet allows you to properly equip soldiers for the fight ahead.  You can equip four types of soldiers at this time, depending on your needs.  All of them fulfill a very specific purpose.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00161=We understand you are already familiar with Incinerators, Heavy Gunners, and Infantrymen.  You will also be able to equip mortar troopers at this outpost as an inexpensive long-range counter to ground enemies.  
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00162=Repeat that Darren, over.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00163=Got it.  Listen up people!  Darren says we've got a whole mess of these Roaches about a half-a-mile out on Congress and they're coming right at us!  I want both flanks covered now!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00164=Sergeant, did you say Darren's out there watching our six?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00165=I've got Darren half-a-mile out spottin for us in the clock tower.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00166=Here they come!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00167=Open fire!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00168=Ah yeah!  The cavalry has arrived!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00169=That's the last of'em Davis, we're movin.  Got a date with the armed forces.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00170=Come on man!  Keep these things off of me!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00171=Davis pull the curtain down dammit!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00172=Commander, we can't stay here!  The Trans-Texas underground tunnels are a couple blocks away, if they're not overrun.  It's one hell of a place for a holdout; one way in, one way out!  We can pelt these bastards from higher ground as long as we keep the flying ones off of us.  
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00173=Darren, are you reading me?
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00174=Myra?  I had a feeling you would make it through this thing. I've got your back, don't worry.  Fog's making it tough so I can't see too far out, but you get- 
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00175=Darren, you've done all the spotting you can for us.  I want every officer at your station to fall back to my position.  We're pulling out in less than five.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00176=You don't have to ask me twice, I'm on my way.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00177=Commander, I heard over comms what you're trying to do here.  Those civvies aren't going anywhere without cover.  I'm inbound with armored transport.  Yeah, I know I borrowed it, but if I didn't you'd have lost it in the riot zone, so be happy and  cover my ass!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00178=Okay people, load up!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00179=That's all I can pack in for this run.  Get the next group of civvies prepped, I'll get these folks to the southbound T.T. tunnel entrance.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00180=Let's go people!  Go go go!  Come on, this ain't city transit!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00181=Alright that's it.  I'm on my way back to the tunnel.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00182=Looks like everyone's loaded up, Commander.  I'm on my way back to the tunnel now.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00183=Shit!  Engine just died!  These things are coming out of the ground here!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00184=Aw, dammit the alpha van just stalled out!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00185=Alright!  Engine's back!  Let's finish this thing!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00186=Commander, we have engineers on the other side of the south tunnel entrance working to excavate the debris.  We cannot set charges or we risk collapsing the tunnel entirely.  You will need to keep the civilians safe until we open the roads.  Our spotters show the enemy is entering the northern tunnel in waves.  You will have time to reinforce your position after each wave is routed.  Make good use of it.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00187=This is bullshit!  Commander, I'm gonna have to unload the civvies here until the engineering corps breaks through the debris.  You'll need to keep these folks safe so I can pick up the next group.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00188=I'm on my way back to pick up the next group now.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00189=Commander, group two is unloaded.  Keep'em covered.  I'm heading back to base.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00190=That's everyone, Commander.  I'll hang here with these folks until the tunnel's open.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00191=...
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00192=...
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00193=...
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00194=Listen to me, Commander whatever your name is.  I don't appreciate the whole bait and switch ya'll got goin here.  First, you tell me and my family to head down to the police station for our safety. Then... you tell me I've gotta leave the police station and wander around with you morons and say hello to all these things that are tearin up the neighborhood.  And, you tell me you're all outta guns so I've got to rely on you to keep me from gettin killed!  Just so you know, if things start getting ugly, I'm gone!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00195=Hey, Commander whatever, you didn't say anything about goin to the power control room.  This is a one-way gig ya hear? We have one door in, and the same door out.  If these things find us down there, we're cut the hell off.  And yeah, I'm still goin in don't worry.  If I leave you chuckleheads to figure it out, I reckon you'll take down the whole grid.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00196=Alright listen good you bacon crisps.  There's three consoles in here that each handle some of the power load.  You followin?  I'm not seeing heads nod so I gotta be sure.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00197=I gotta reroute power for all three consoles?  Ya'll still look like you're clueless so let me say it different.  When I'm done with the first console, I'm gonna haul ass to the second one.  And you better cover me when I do.  I've only got five minutes once I start this thing to finish the whole cycle or half the city'll black out.  So there's no waitin, no slow movin.  When I'm done, I run.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00198=Okay, this ain't good.  Looks like somewhere down the line we lost a few of the nodes so there's no parallel backup.  Oh yeah, I keep forgettin who I'm talkin to.  I have to route the power from one place to another and things'll black out in here for a few seconds when I do.  I hope ya'll can see in the dark.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00199=First one down, movin to the next console!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00200=That's two! Movin' to number three!

Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00202=Now before you go runnin off to help that cop friend of yours who was just squawkin on your comm box, I'd appreciate if ya'll took me back to my family, ya hear?!
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00203=All officers, a group of civilians is stranded at the R&C on Landry in the Red Zone and require a rescue.  Be advised that women and children are among them.
Conversation/EP01M02_1/Line00204=UPL has dispatched an air lift.  Any officers responding, ensure the creatures do not breach the location until the escort arrives.

There's no way to get to the Mayor, and more and more of these things are comin after us.  I'm getting the hell outta here.  The sergeant here can hold the lobby so you can go find him upstairs if you wanna die too.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00135=Commander, I'm taking one of the SWAT vans, and thanks.  I wouldn't leave the other one sitting out here too long.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00136=Ah, finally.  His excellency arrives.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00137=Are you okay, your honor?
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00138=I'll be better if we can get to a safe zone officer, all things considered.

Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00141=Dammit, I knew these idiots were going to riot!  I knew it!  The road to the tunnel is totally blocked! Totally blocked!  The only way we're getting there is on foot.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00142=Stand behind me, your honor.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00143=Davis, we're bailing the hell out of here!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00144=Are they extraterrestrials sir?
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00145=We have not ruled out that possibility.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00146=We're receiving reports that these creatures are appearing in urban centers worldwide.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00147=All active military forces in the affected areas are being mobilized.  We're also working with the UPL Council to federalize regional law enforcement pers-

Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00150=This is A.U.D. 442 to dispatch, what is the rally point for TAC?  
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00151=There's a full riot group moving to Dessau and Congress in about five minutes.  I'm headin there now.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00152=Okay Commander, Sergeant, Corporal...looks like it's just us.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00153=Holy...these things have been here what, three hours?  And it already looks like they've been here for years.  I don't know what they've got growing here but we're taking it down.  All of it!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00154=Commander, that sounds like a great idea.  If the francine gas processing center is here, we'll create an explosion so powerful it will put these things in orbit.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00155=Aw, shit!  We've got more inbound!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00156=And from what the troops are telling me, the officer assigned to the UPL battalion was killed so Commander, looks like you're up.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00157=Commander, we understand you have taken tactical command of outpost four ninety-seven.  You are not properly trained in combat theater operations, so we are here to provide assistance.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00158=And in case you are not familiar with our purpose, the United Powers League Defense Net is a singular point of information processing and communication across all areas of combat command.  Said differently, we make sure the left hand knows what the right hand is up to, something very much necessary with standing forces deployed worldwide.  
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00159=Outpost four ninety-seven is minimally equipped.  We have air dropped raw materials for fabrication of key facilities and armor and weapons for new troops.  You will need to use the headquarters building to manufacture mining drones, and command them to harvest the nearby materials.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00160=Good work, Commander.  Now, the Billet allows you to properly equip soldiers for the fight ahead.  You can equip four types of soldiers at this time, depending on your needs.  All of them fulfill a very specific purpose.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00161=We understand you are already familiar with Incinerators, Heavy Gunners, and Infantrymen.  You will also be able to equip mortar troopers at this outpost as an inexpensive long-range counter to ground enemies.  
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00162=Repeat that Darren, over.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00163=Got it.  Listen up people!  Darren says we've got a whole mess of these Roaches about a half-a-mile out on Congress and they're coming right at us!  I want both flanks covered now!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00164=Sergeant, did you say Darren's out there watching our six?
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00165=I've got Darren half-a-mile out spottin for us in the clock tower.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00166=Here they come!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00167=Open fire!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00168=Ah yeah!  The cavalry has arrived!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00169=That's the last of'em Davis, we're movin.  Got a date with the armed forces.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00170=Come on man!  Keep these things off of me!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00171=Davis pull the curtain down dammit!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00172=Commander, we can't stay here!  The Trans-Texas underground tunnels are a couple blocks away, if they're not overrun.  It's one hell of a place for a holdout; one way in, one way out!  We can pelt these bastards from higher ground as long as we keep the flying ones off of us.  
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00173=Darren, are you reading me?
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00174=Myra?  I had a feeling you would make it through this thing. I've got your back, don't worry.  Fog's making it tough so I can't see too far out, but you get- 
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00175=Darren, you've done all the spotting you can for us.  I want every officer at your station to fall back to my position.  We're pulling out in less than five.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00176=You don't have to ask me twice, I'm on my way.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00177=Commander, I heard over comms what you're trying to do here.  Those civvies aren't going anywhere without cover.  I'm inbound with armored transport.  Yeah, I know I borrowed it, but if I didn't you'd have lost it in the riot zone, so be happy and  cover my ass!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00178=Okay people, load up!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00179=That's all I can pack in for this run.  Get the next group of civvies prepped, I'll get these folks to the southbound T.T. tunnel entrance.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00180=Let's go people!  Go go go!  Come on, this ain't city transit!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00181=Alright that's it.  I'm on my way back to the tunnel.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00182=Looks like everyone's loaded up, Commander.  I'm on my way back to the tunnel now.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00183=Shit!  Engine just died!  These things are coming out of the ground here!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00184=Aw, dammit the alpha van just stalled out!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00185=Alright!  Engine's back!  Let's finish this thing!
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00186=Commander, we have engineers on the other side of the south tunnel entrance working to excavate the debris.  We cannot set charges or we risk collapsing the tunnel entirely.  You will need to keep the civilians safe until we open the roads.  Our spotters show the enemy is entering the northern tunnel in waves.  You will have time to reinforce your position after each wave is routed.  Make good use of it.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00187=This is bullshit!  Commander, I'm gonna have to unload the civvies here until the engineering corps breaks through the debris.  You'll need to keep these folks safe so I can pick up the next group.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00188=I'm on my way back to pick up the next group now.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00189=Commander, group two is unloaded.  Keep'em covered.  I'm heading back to base.
Conversation/EP01M02_2/Line00190=That's everyone, Commander.  I'll hang here with these folks until the tunnel's open.

Conversation/EP01M03/Line00005=All units, Katherine, I say again, Katherine.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00006=Alright, that's our song!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00007=Commander, welcome to day five of the war. Your first task is to retake the City of Austin, TX. The TR-17s have already done the heavy lifting for you as you can see. 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00008=Don't worry Commander, we were...mostly successful in evacuating civilians before the roaches had arrived in Austin. The buildings were quite empty when the shells landed, we think.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00009=Move your teams into the city and clear out whatever roach creatures remain. Once the downtown area is secured, we will begin expanding our canvas to the suburbs. Defense Net, out.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00010=We are detecting some of the roaches' workers in your teams' immediate vicinity. We had hoped our shelling of the city destroyed all of them but it would seem at least a few have survived. The workers can quickly rebuild their nests if left unchecked. Find them all Commander, and dispose of them. 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00011=Commander, as you progress through the city, Defense Net will send reinforcements to secure the area street by street behind you. If defense becomes untenable, fall back to these barricades and the troops there will assist you.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00012=Hold up, we need some arties for this one.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00013=This is Snow Mount to Retaliation, over.

Conversation/EP01M03/Line00020=(100% Hit) Retaliation, CEP Zero with high order detonation.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00021=Alright people, we got more Roaches to kill. Let's move.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00022=What did we just see?
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00023=I uh, I've never seen anything like that!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00024=... Effective fourteen thirty-four hours, I'm taking command of the unit.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00025=Orders, sarge?
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00026=Orders, are you kidding me? Set up a perimeter. Use the top of these two buildings here for recon. I'm calling for an airlift for the LT.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00027=We need to finish up here and then send someone for Trenchard once Austin's locked down. We can't hang around here Sergeant.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00028=I'm not leaving the LT in the middle of the street lady! I don't care what's goin' on in the world! You hearin me?! Stuff a cork in it and sit your ass down! 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00029=As I was saying...we're gonna finish what we started and when we burn these bastards outta here, we'll send a team back for any casualties. Anyone else wanna take charge? 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00030=Alright...then let's go.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00031=Run!!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00032=Get out of here! There's a boatload of Roaches inbound!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00033=Oh, we're running anywhere people.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00034=You said we were gonna finish our sweep and head out. The LT wouldn't want us signing up for this BS last stand! 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00035=Trust me everyone, when we're done here, the only blood on the streets will be the Roaches'!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00036=You're right, staying in this spot is BS. We're moving to the closest gas station. 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00037=Commander, the Roaches are attempting to breach your perimeter. We have five squads in the immediate area which can assist and TR-17s on standby. Ensure the roaches do not compromise your barricades. Defense Net, out. 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00038=Gold sector barricades are secure, Commander. We'll send additional reinforcements as soon as we're able. Clean and Sweep teams are continuing north. Defense Net, out.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00039=Commander, your team has just entered the city's Green Sector. The Roaches never breached our barricades in this area so we've not been forced to use artillery there. Some of the buildings might even have power. 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00040=Oh hell, I thought the UPL evacuated the city! 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00041=I guess they wanted to stay with their homes...or whatever.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00042=We're not leaving them to the Roaches that's for sure. Trooper, you know how to use that rifle scope?
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00043=Yes ma'am, top order marksman in the sweatshop.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00044=Take out the Roaches chasing those people around down there. DO NOT MISS!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00045=Yes ma'am!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00046=Great shooting, Trooper! Hey you can cover my back anytime.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00047=Roaches are continuing to advance against the city and Central Command has begun withdrawing its sweep teams.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00048=Okay here's the plan. We know we've got a ton of those roaches right behind us. We're gonna rig these gas pumps to belch fire. With a few thousand gallons of fuel underground I'm betting they won't run dry for awhile. 
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00049=Did I hear ya right? Yer tryin' to light up my gas pumps?
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00050=Yeah... you got a better idea?
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00051=Not now that you've lured the roaches here. I just need to shut down the safeties. Pumps won't shoot very far unless I crank up the pressure. I can take care of both in the underground tank.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00052=Is that gonna take very long? We're just a bit short on time here!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00053=Few minutes I guess. I don't move real quick in case you haven't noticed.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00054=Alright keep our man there covered people, and get set up to make a not-so-BS last stand. We don't have much time.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00055=Round two everyone! Get the wounded into the food mart; have the medics take a look!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00056=Hey! HEY! Pumps are ready to go! You listenin' to me?! Pumps are re-
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00057=LIGHT' EM!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00058=Flyers coming in! Screaming like banshees.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00059=The heck with this, we're gettin' the hell out of here!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00060=This is Surface Rounder. Authenticator 99N6A. All units receiving this message be advised...Trinity has been activated. You have ten minutes to regroup at the Meadows. Surface Rounder, out.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00061=Trinity?! Is that what I think it is?!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00062=They're gonna hit the area with a FAB ma'am.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00063=There any other sweep teams with an active transport nearby?
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00064=Not sure ma'am, the LT had our only two way comms
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00065=Okay then, we run for it.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00066=We've got at least one Battle Buddy up ahead ma'am. They can rally with us, and we sure as hell need the firepower.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00067=All units receiving this message, be advised. Trinity will commence in five minutes. Surface Rounder, out.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00068=All units receiving this message be advised, Trinity will commence in sixty seconds. Be at the Meadows by the end of the countdown. Surface Rounder, out.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00069=Finally! Pack it in there people, we've got NO TIME!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00070=Instructions received, Commander.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00071=Your orders are confirmed, we'll pass the word
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00072=We'll pass your orders onto the squad leaders.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00073=Defense Net acknowledges receipt of your orders.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00074=We'll assign an engineering team to construct a barricade at the point you specified.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00075=Roger that we'll direct fireteams to secure that position.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00076=Deploying reinforcements as instructed.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00077=We're dispatching reinforcements now.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00078=Commander, the squad acknowledges your orders and is moving.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00079=The squad is engaging the enemy.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00080=Your attack orders have been confirmed, Commander.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00081=There's a ton of those things right behind us Sergeant!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00082=I don't know what you people are doing here but you want to be somewhere else, trust me!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00083=Roaches are continuing to advance against the city and Central Command has begun withdrawing its sweep teams.

Conversation/EP01M03/Line00089=Alright, looks like the artillery hit everything but the roaches.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00090=Ugh... Let's clean up their mess.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00091=Just when you think the roaches can't get any uglier - boom, jeez that thing's gonna crack the visor of my helmet just looking at me!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00092=Commander, i saw some after-action repots that there's some nasty beast down here that jumps around like a grasshopper, tore our guys a new one when they landed. Got a pool on who kills it first so, show me the money.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00093=I'm behind you all the way Davis, lock and load.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00094=Hey gramps! we're gonna be overrun here if you don't move your ass. Hurry up!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00095=Alright then, hope that guy got done whatever he needed to get done. At least we don't have to carry him outta here when we leave.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00096=Hey! Think i hear some weapons fire to the right, it's close. Might be those battle buddies you were talking about.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00097=I've had just about enough of these screamers!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00098=Landing pad, dead ahead!
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00099=See that fellas, i told you someone would make their way out here. Defense Net said y'all would be coming, i got orders to get you to the base of operations, follow me.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00100=Commander, we have reports from several squads that the roaches are gathered near the Capitol complex, we think they're going to push soon.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00101=You'll need to reinforce your position there to ensure the fabrication facilities don't go offline. You cannot abandon your barricades either commander, or they'll break through to the inner city.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00102=Commander, we have reports of multiple Behemoths inbound to your position.
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00103=Commander, you may construct a Forward Operating Base or F.O.B., the FOB allows you to train Infantry Officers and construct Combat Support Vehicles
Conversation/EP01M03/Line00104=In both cases they are critical to your success in offensive and defensive operations, i recommend fabricating an F.O.B. at this time.

Conversation/EP01M04/Line00001=This is Alpha Two Tango to Liberty actual on a secured line, the Baker's Shop is secured, over.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00002=Alpha Two Tango, there is a very large refugee encampment approximately fifty miles east of your location.  It is imperative all roach presence be eliminated near your base of operations to ensure the safety of the encampment.  We need to stay ahead of their breeders, Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00003=Roger that Liberty Actual, Alpha Two Tango, out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00004=CARR, read the tea leaves, and tell me about the topographical map.  Where would these sons o' bitches hole up in this place?
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00005=Colonel Graves, the Douglas County Castlewood Canyon State Park is approximately 2,621 acres sir. There is a substantial number of points for subterranean ingress and egress.  Shall I review them for you beginning with the closest point to the-
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00006=CARR, I asked for the most likely location, not every possible location. CRIPE!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00007=Of course, sir. The Cherry Creek Rock Shelter was utilized for prehistoric settlements in this region. Due to the relatively even nature of the topography in that area, it would be most feasible for the alien organisms to establish a defense in or directly around-
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00008=Thank you. Commander, CARR just marked the location on the tactical display. Get a crew out there and see what's crawlin'. It's a recon op only Commander. Have the Z-1s do a fly-by and do not engage the enemy unless engaged by the enemy. And yes, in that case, it's weapons free. Dismissed.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00009=This is Ice Skater to Lakeport, we've got Roach activity in sector kilo seven, clean-up on aisle four, out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00010=This is Ice Skater to lakeport, I'm detecting a den of spitters and rodents over the next hill.  Request weapons free for the badgers, over. 
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00011=Ice Skater, that is confirmed.  Badgers are green.  Out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00012=This is Ice Skater to Lakeport.  We have a blimp sighting in sector Kilo nine, over.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00013=Ice Skater, go around or fill the crock pot.  Lakeport is not ready for houseguests.  Over.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00014=Roger that Lakeport.  I think company's coming whether or not we've had maid service.  Ice Skater out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00015=This is Ice Skater to Lakeport. The roach stew has been cooked. Moving to point Lancer. Out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00016=This is Ice Skater to Lakeport.  The motel's full at Lancer and getting fuller by the minute.  We've got eyes on a pressure cooker and an oven, and I think the guests are gonna check out soon.  We've got time to take out one appliance only.  Requesting instructions, over.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00017=You've got operational discretion Ice Skater. You know the consequences either way. Alpha Two Tango out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00018=This is Ice Skater to Lakeport.  The oven's in the dumpster.  Out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00019=This is Ice Skater to Lakeport.  The pressure cooker's in the dumpster.  Out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00020=Uh....this is Ice Skater to Lakeport.  You've got some old friends coming into town.  Out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00021=Commander, seeing as this is your first time in the field, you may not be familiar with all of our equipment and facilities.  I urge you to remember your coursework at the Officer's Academy, sir.  You will have time to re-read the technical manuals after you repulse the alien organisms in this next engagement.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00022=We've got roaches inbound in a couple minutes people, get hot!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00023=Commander, abort!  I say again, abort all field efforts!  Get your people back to base, now!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00024=Roaches are inside the perimeter!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00025=I need artillery fire at all coordinates in Sector Juliet!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00026=Impressive commander.  For a desk jockey, I'd expect you to be choking on your own stomach juices right now.  I've got Defense Net on comms, the base is yours. Keep those maggots out of it!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00027=Commander, I regret to inform you that we lost most of our locally stored UPL Datanet files during last night's attack, and our ability to download new ones is impaired while we rebuild our infrastructure.  Colonel Graves has assigned me to assist you in familiarizing yourself with our field capabilities in lieu of the Datanet.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00028=Due to your experience in the cities of Odessa and Austin, Texas, you are already familiar with our headquarters, mining drones, and the infantry Billet.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00029=Mining drones have since received an upgrade from the UPL engineering corps that allows them to repair damaged structures and vehicles.  Simply select the mining drone you wish to use for repairs, and then select a damaged structure or vehicle in the base.  There are several as a result of last night's attack.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00030=As you can see, Commander,  when a mining drone disassembles into its component nanite parts, it is able to utilize those nanites to repair the structure or vehicle selected.  Unfortunately, this process is not reversible, and the mining drone cannot be recovered.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00031=The Manufacturing Facility allows you to build TR-17 mobile artillery, A-6 anti-air platforms, and heavily armored Routhe tanks. Utilize a mining drone to construct a Manufacturing Facility when you are ready, Commander.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00032=Now that you have a Manufacturing Facility and a Headquarters structure, you may construct a Forward Operating Base or F.O.B.  The F.O.B. allows you to train infantry officers and construct combat support vehicles.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00033=In both cases, they are critical to your success in offensive and defensive operations.  I recommend fabricating an F.O.B. at this time.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00034=Commander, the UPL provides three structures which possess combat capabilities.  The first is an electro-static defense tower or E.S.D.  You will see several of these already in place inside of our perimeter.  The other two structures, the Nightjar and Solitaire, are not available for construction until our connection to the UPL Datanet is restored.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00035=Unfortunately, we also lack the ability to fabricate an air strip for the same reason, Commander.  However you can construct an R&D facility which allows you to provide your infantry and vehicles with specialized upgrades, should you require them.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00036=Commander. Take it from someone who knows a thing or two about fighting the roaches. Combat infantry adapt to almost any tactical situation.  Use'em...use a lot of'em.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00037=Don't worry too much about base camp either, sir.  The Electrostatic Defense Stations can hold their own against the Roaches.  Ground or air, if the Roaches get near'em, they'll be turned into charcoal powder.  Just don't let the Roaches take out the exhumers.  Francine gas isn't stable...if the exhumers go, the blast will level our entire mining operation.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00038=Be advised Commander that your visibility will be severely hampered by up slope fog in your area.  Our weather satellites also report instances of heavier 'Flash Fog' in the region but these should dissipate shortly after they form due to rapid fluctuations in temperature.  The flash fog significantly reduces aerial combat capabilities, so you're boots on the ground for this one, literally.  Defense Net Out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00039=We are tracking a Flash Fog formation in a few moments.  Move your troops to higher ground Commander, if you have not already.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00040=The roaches' nests have added particulates to the air which further impede our ability to use instrumentation to track their movements, in addition to the fog.  We are still working on that problem, so visibility is key.  Ensure your troops are on higher ground before flash fog forms or visibility drops to almost zero.  Since our thermo-imagers and motion sensors do not detect the roaches' movements, if you're caught in a fogged area, you'll be caught by surprise and will not be able to return fire.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00041=The Flash Fog has dissipated.  Use this time to finish your reconnaissance missions.  Going forward, we will alert you to a flash fog event using the following audio tone.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00042=This is Ice Skater to Lake Port.  Do you read?  Over!
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00043=Reading you loud and clear Ice Skater.  Glad you didn't have to meet the relatives earlier.  What's your status, over.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00044=Be advised Lakeport, the landlord's on his way to evict Charlie Actual and he's bringing the national guard.  Blimps count ten.  Behemoths count three. Spitters count twenty.  Rodents a hundred and change.  We're moving to the house.  Ice Skater out.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00045=We have a cubic shitload of roaches inbound Commander! 
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00046=We keep hitting them, they keep hitting us!  We need to put these things down for good before we're overrun! Commander, our F.O.B. is the only thing that keeps the UPL on the offensive for a hundred miles in any direction!  If we lose this position, the refugee camp is gonna be next.  So we've got two options.  We fold up the enemy...or we die.  But I'm not falling back to Utah and watching 150,000 men, women, and children get slaughtered!  We hold the line.  End of story.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00047=Commander, it appears that the alien organisms have established ancillary dens in the vicinity of their nest.  Data from our Z1 reconnaissance team provides details for your review. Neutralizing these sites has a high probability of weakening the nest's garrison from reinforcing its position following our next offensives.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00048=Commander, nice work on the den.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00049=Commander, the Forward Operating Base is equipped to repulse the alien organisms now that the defensive framework has been suitably constructed, allowing you to engage in offensive operations.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00050=Alright Commander.  I'll retract everything I've ever said about pen pushers.  You've got brass-
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00051=Colonel Graves sir, my apologies for interrupting you.  UPL Defense Net is requesting an update.  They are asking when we can-
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00052=Commander, this is UPL Defense Net coordinator Mada. Colonel Graves has told us of your achievements in the field. On behalf of all of us involved with Operation Elpis, I thank you. We are sending a relief regiment to establish a base of operations in your region.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00053=Defense Net is reassigning our battalion, Commander. Wheels up in 24 hours so get some sleep.
Conversation/EP01M04/Line00054=(Unused) Move to the next phase of the operation, i know i know. They've been asking for these damn situation reports before we even had the first jiddy up and running out here. Commander, you've got those son's of bitches bottled up, finish it!.

Conversation/EP01M05/Line00001=Reginald Four-Niner this is Childress Six.  I have a screamer locked up on the outer perimeter.  Request clearance to engage, over.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00002=Childress six, no watercraft are within half a click on Z, you are weapons free.  Good luck.  Reginald Four-Niner, out.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00003=Yeah! Whew! One roach down!  This is Childress Six, returning to the garage for grooming, out.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00004=Colonel, the roaches are raiding farms all over the country.  Wouldn't we be more useful helping Defense Net with those ops sir?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00005=So in case any of you ladies and gents didn't have time to read your briefing packets while you were in the can this morning, Defense Net believes the roaches hit U.S. farms and the larger food processing centers for reasons other than enemy supply deprivation.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00006=But, none of that matters to us today.  Today, the roaches are dumping toxins into the lake, and right now, that is all Defense Net says we should be caring about, so that is all I care about.  Therefore, it's all you should care about.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00007=No disrespect intended, sir.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00008=Every fish in Lake Michigan's going to bubble to the surface dead if we don't put an end to whatever these critters have goin on out here.  No more fish means a lot less food to spread around. 
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00009=Defense Net has more than a hundred battalions clearing out these roach toxic waste dumps around the world.  We just need to make sure that we do our part in the campaign.  CARR, what's tactical have to say?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00010=The toxins are binding rapidly with the water's hydrogen, converting the molecules into a new substance similar in composition to the excretions which coat the ground near the aliens' dwellings.  If fourteen percent of the lake's water is converted, the chain reaction will not be reversible. 
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00011=It was a hell of a win for the good guys today, don't ya think?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00012=Colonel Graves, sir.  May I ask you a question?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00013=Sure CARR.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00014=You do not exhibit the typical physiological response I have come to expect in a victory event.  Are you experiencing any health issues, sir?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00015=Do you know the first thing I've done the last six days when I wake up?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00016=I am not with you at that time of day sir, so it is not possible for me to respond to this question accurately.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00017=First thing I do when I get up is read the global situation reports.  Every day, the Roaches cover more and more of our land mass!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00018=It won't make a damn bit of difference what we do out here, or how many Roaches we kill.  It doesn't matter how many nests we torch! 
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00019=Last night, I read Defense Net's complete analysis on the farm situation.  The roaches aren't eating the cows, or the sheep or any of it...they're using the animals as food for their eggs.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00020=Sir, there is a finite supply of livestock.  The aliens will be unable to breed once the supply of mammalian creatures has been depleted.  This presents itself as a tactical advantage.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00021=No, CARR.  Be glad you're a VI instead of an AI, or you'd be scared shitless just thinking about it.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00022=Commander, CARR's marked what thermographics shows as the roaches' hot spots.  Recon the area; I need to see what we're dealing with.  
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00023=Tunneler!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00024=The roaches are dug in all over the place out here!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00025=We were fearful of this outcome, Commander. We chose you to spring this trap since our other officers are too valuable to send on suicide missions.  Imagine our surprise to see you actually live through it.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00026=The roaches are clearly deploying bait to have us move our teams away from our bases, and then they launch counterattacks.  Use caution commander, when you move, do so in force and don't leave your bases without a suitable garrison.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00027=CARR, what the hell are those small round things in the middle of the base?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00028=Sergeant Jerico, based on my analysis of field reports in the combat datanet, it is likely these are the alien organisms' oospores.  This could explain the aliens' decision to establish a nest near the shoreline.  It is possible that the moisture accelerates the incubation process.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00029=What the hell is an oospore?
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00030=Sergeant Jerico, please stand by.  I am searching my linguistic database for a synonym.  
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00031=An oospore is roughly equivalent to an egg, Sergeant Jerico.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00032=So we've got a Roach breeding center, then.  That bumps the TZ's priority all the way to Crimson.  Commander, have a Condor drop in a nuke team and turn that entire Roach motel into a crater!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00033=Colonel Graves sir, due to the finite dimensions of the Lake, detonation of nuclear ordinance in proximity to the water will cause significant distress to the sub-surface ecosystem.  In addition, it will generate tidal events which will capsize our watercraft.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00034=Yeah, he's right, crazy at it sounds Commander, there's still civvies fishing out here.  Go figure that out. Commander, you need to torch every last one of the Roach structures and especially the eggs the good ol' fashioned way.  And no Commander, our original orders haven't changed.  We still need to protect the lake too.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00035=Commander, satellite images show the alien organisms are moving, sir.  The aliens must have detected your force on approach to their nest.  I recommend reinforcing our defensive position sir, to prepare for a possible counterattack.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00036=Commander, please note that lake toxicity levels have reached ten percent.  The process will not be reversible if contaminants continue to be introduced into the water.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00037=Commander, the roaches have completely disabled the suborbital surveillance net in your region!  We will not be able to feed you real-time telemetry for the remainder of your mission!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00038=And if that's not enough, the roaches have worked around our early warning systems and shielded themselves from detection.  You won't know they're coming until they're in your visual radius. I hope Graves knows what he's doing putting you in tactical command.  Probably not, but what do I know, I'm just an analyst.  Defense Net out. 
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00039=Commander, allow me to familiarize you with additional structures which UPL Defense Net has made available for deployment in this combat zone.  I recommend you construct an air strip as soon as practicable.  This will allow you to build Osprey attack helicopters, Raptor fighter jets, and Condor transports.  You will need these vehicles to ensure mission success.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00040=While you were constructing the air strip, Commander, I evaluated our defensive posture and believe it is not adequate due to the large, uncontrolled area in which our base is situated.  
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00041=While infantry are excellent in offensive operations, defensively their low survivability presents tactical concerns for UPL Defense Net.  For this reason, they have given us access to the Nightjar and Solitaire buildings.  I recommend constructing one of these now, sir.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00042=The Nightjar and Solitaire are stationary defensive structures that are not automated, unlike the Electrostatic Defense Towers.  In order to power these facilities, you must order an infantry pilot to assume control.  Move any of your infantry to the completed structure now, sir.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00043=The Nightjar and Solitaire are both considerably more powerful and durable than an ESD, however if it is destroyed, the infantry pilot is killed as well.  
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00044=The Nightjar is designed for long-range anti-vehicle use, while the Solitaire is a powerful industrial flame discharge facility.  
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00045=Defense Net advises you to experiment with their placement until you find a tactical premise that aligns with your battle strategies.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00046=Commander, it is clear from the volume of attacks that the roaches have rebuilt their nest to the east.  Clearly you weren't thorough in your reconnaissance over there.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00047=Now you have to destroy it again before they grow more bleeders!  Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00048=Commander, guess what.  The roaches knocked our Satellite Net completely offline while you've been lollygagging around, so now we can't pinpoint the other bleeders!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00049=All we can tell you is the remaining Bleeders are north to northeast of your forward operating base, and they are protected by rock formations.  You will need to move in by air.  Think you can get this one right?  Defense Net out.   
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00050=We have a couple Z1s running around Commander, and they found three smaller egg farms.  I know we're spread thin here, so...if you need to take some of Charlie Papa's people, then do it.  They're on guard duty so they can spare the heads.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00051=Colonel Graves, sir.  Colonel Niches has not given approval for you to take command of his Charlie Papa battalion in addition to your own, sir.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00052=Well there's a first.  Having my orders questioned by a machine.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00053=CARR unit! Override, override!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00054=Colonel Graves, sir.  The CARR unit that just spoke with you is assigned to Colonel Niches.  The CARR unit assigned to you, myself, has no concerns relative to the reassignment of Colonel Niches' troops.  It is important for me to clarify this point, sir.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00055=Colonel, you have my full support.  I'll have the VI squad address the challenge protocols in my local CARR vector.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00056=Roger that, Ben. Thanks.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00057=Colonel Graves sir, my apologies for the confusion.  It is unusual to have more than one of my model at the same base of operations.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00058=Stay on point, CARR.  I have enough damn drama from the people in my battalion.  Don't need it from the VI too. 
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00059=What a mess!  Roach guts...everywhere!  I'm loving this duty, Commander!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00060=The impact of the destruction of those eggs is already registering.  The lake contamination rate has dropped by 15%.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00061=Commander, you have further reduced the lake contamination rate by 10% sir.
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00062=Commander, the lake contamination rate from the oospores has dropped another 25% for a total of 50%.  
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00063=Looks like you can tell the civvies they can keep their trawlers out a bit longer.  Defense Net just said that Lake Michigan's entire shoreline is code green!
Conversation/EP01M05/Line00064=Commander, we're spreading out the Z1 platoons to ensure none of the roaches' breeders try to grow a new nest.  We'll sweep up the dust and be home before you turn out the night light sir.

Conversation/EP01M06/Line00001=Commander, welcome to the thick.  Tactical authority over this prison facility's garrison has been transferred to you, effective immediately.  Also, we have replaced your last analyst, she was sacked for... insubordination; under normal circumstances we'd send her to that prison you're at...maybe we still will, if we lose.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00002=We retrofitted this penitentiary into a makeshift research facility and its location...has obviously been compromised.  Your exfiltration team is en route to evacuate the last surviving researcher.  This VIP must be protected at any cost!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00003=We have constructed perimeter defenses and reinforced the security fences around the landing yard, however, the roaches are tearing down our walls one section at a time.  The breaches will create a natural choke point for the enemy, however.  Use them to your advantage.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00004=Commander, the UPL has classified this operation as Crimson Priority. That means you get first pick of available resources and personnel.  We'll send you whatever you need to maintain your position, just give the order.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00005=Commander, reinforcements from the city have arrived to secure this location.  I detect large amounts of movement by the alien organisms in the area surrounding this facility; I believe a permanent defense is untenable.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00006=The exfiltration team is on orders direct from Fleet Admiral Hayes and is not in the standard chain of command.  Defense Net has no authority over them.  Hayes has also ordered that you be transferred to his special forces team as well, Commander, to oversee the VIP's evacuation.  Defense Net will maintain the perimeter until you're clear.  Good luck.

Conversation/EP01M06/Line00009=The Roaches just took out a fuel truck and ripped a hole in the east wall!  We need help out here!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00010=This is Major Hendricks, I need two fire teams covering points E through H!  I'm on my way out there myself, out!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00011=Major, sir.  UPL Defense Net, per your earlier statements, has specifically tasked our unit to retrieve and ensure safe exfiltration of the VIP.  We are unable to subordinate that priority to your tactical needs.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00012=You're shittin me right?  What about the rest of ya? You helping my men out there or are you helping this walking dishwasher?
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00013=*Screams*
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00014=Let's finish what we started and get the VIP.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00015=Never thought I'd be glad to see a C.A.R.R.  Nice shot, man!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00016=*Distant roaring*
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00017=Tunneler!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00018=Commander, some of the alien organisms have entered the main facility.  Their numbers are minimal, sir.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00019=Emergency power activated!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00020=Authenticator Charlie 262, exfiltration of VIP.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00021=Oh, this minx is all yours.  We're moving to that wonderful place called...elsewhere. Oh, and we're not coming back, so help yourself to some grenades or whatever if you need them, anyway...cheerio!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00022=Ma'am, we have a craft waiting outside to evacuate you to Temple Blue.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00023=I'm with you sir.  I'll help you get the VIP to the transport.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00024=Get me the hell out of here, please!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00025=May I have your attention please.  This is a fire alarm.  Please move to the nearest exit.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00026=Okaaay...
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00027=Sir, I will distract the alien organisms as they emerge from their worm, and I will hold this position as long as possible.  Good luck, Commander.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00028=Alert! Please exit the building, this is an emergency.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00029=Okay, the music's just stopped and we're a few chairs short for everyone to sit.  You'll need to run for it ma'am.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00030=Umm...what?
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00031=We won't be able to kill all those things before they kill us.  I'm gonna go pop one and draw them away.  You need to run your ass off and get to the Condor.  If you get boxed in, find someplace dark, don't let'em smell you, and just hide. They'll go away after a bit.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00032=No...no...no...there's no way, there's absolutely no way!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00033=Do it or die ma'am.  Your call.
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00034=Fire in the hole!

Conversation/EP01M06/Line00039=*Spitter screams*
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00041=Take off!  Take off now!  Go Go Go!
Conversation/EP01M06/Line00042=Your compliment is appreciated, Private Tucker.
Conversation/EP01M07/Group00001=AllLines
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00001=Colonel Gideon, we are breaking radio silence.  Abort mission, I say again, abort mission.  The Roaches have surrounded your position.  Retreat to the drop zone for evac.  Defense net out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00002=Commander, we're detecting some pus bags in your proximity.  We're having a hard time achieving a lock on their positions but do have a count.  It's a near certainty that they have detected you as well.  Destroying them should be your top priority or they will continue sending roaches to your position.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00003=Someone take down that pus bag!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00004=Commander, hold your position! We have received telemetry from your team regarding the nest.  We have determined that nest represents a clear danger to the mission after all, and we need you to destroy it, or your northern position will be under continuous attack!  We took the liberty of having Sergeant Trask destroy another structure in the meantime, to keep the roaches distracted a bit longer.  We bought you maybe two to three minutes.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00005=Setting claymores at chokepoints near your position will weaken the roach forces when they return.  Then you can mop up what's left with the pbeams and bury their structures.  Also be aware, we've lost comms with Sergeant Trask.  Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00006=Hey, where's Trask?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00007=Wrench to Ten Star, over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00008=Wrench to Ten Star, over!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00009=We're goin back for him.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00010=You're out of your mind, man.  If the roaches found him they'll be looking around for more of us.  And even if they haven't, they'll sure as shit find us if we sneak around lookin for Trask.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00011=We don't leave our men behind!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00012=You don't know he's dead.  You guys are the best right?  Maybe he's just laying low.  The Roaches are all stirred up and there's no way we'll be able to maneuver around without them finding us.  I lost an entire unit in Galveston trying to pull that shit.  All we can do is move on, mission's bigger than any one person right....Colonel? 
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00013=We'll hit the TZ...but the mission's not over til my entire unit's accounted for.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00014=Well done, Commander.  Proceed north to the next phase of your mission.  You may get lucky and find some vehicles we left behind when we evacuated a few years ago.  They may not be in the best shape, but they should still work.  Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00015=Commander, we believe some of our structures have been...infested, based on research done by Corridor 9 at Temple Blue.  The good news is the structures should be safe for your use even though the roach tendrils have grown into them.  All intelligence indicates the roaches' spores do not affect our electronics.  Clean them out and you should have a ready-made fabrication site.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00016=Alright, we're behind in a big way so we're splittin up into four squads.  One , Two, and Three each take a cop and clear out a zone.  Civvies stay back here with squad four til the area's secure.  Move out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00017=We don't know how Commander, but that roach just erupted into dozens of smaller ones.  We've never seen anything like that!  Get distance and take them out a few at a time!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00018=Commander, it appears the high queen is aiding the Spiker and providing an intra-regional tunneling system.  If you destroy the tunnels, you should be able to corner it and finish it off.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00019=That creature appears to be discharging acidic bile now.  Corner positions will no longer be a viable tactic.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00020=Commander, we have classified this encounter to available to personnel with R Clearance.  As of now, that includes you and your team.  You are prohibited from sharing this with Colonel Gideon or the rest of the insertion group.  We will conduct a formal briefing with all of you upon your return to Temple Blue.  Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00021=All units, get the hell back here, we're under attack!  We're under attack!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00022=That's the last of them, for now at least.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00023=Colonel, what are your orders?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00024=This base was mothballed five years ago after we put down the Boston insurrection.  We're openin it back up for business...right under August's nose.  Sergeant Eckersman, order the unit to break out the mech suits.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00025=I'll pass the word, sir.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00026=I want this perimeter secured!  I want claymores and anti-personnel mines up in the next five minutes!  
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00027=We can't stay here, Colonel.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00028=She's right, Colonel.  The Roaches put out a pheromone or somethin when they get hurt.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00029=We're not staying here any longer than we have to.  And you two have a perimeter to watch.  When I need your advice, trust me, I'll ask.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00030=Sarge, last building's up.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00031=Colonel, the base is fully operational.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00032=We're moving to phase 3.  There's enough raw materials here to manufacture the vehicles we need for Phase 4.  Mech team, get us some STAs and fast.  The Screamers'll be comin.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00033=Colonel, what's our clock sir?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00034=August's two clicks North.  We need to get there in fifteen minutes or every **** on the eastern seaboard'll be on top of us.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00035=Five minutes left people, let's haul it!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00036=Sergeant, we're moving to phase four...now.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00037=Alright people, pack everything into the Condors...we're on our way to meet August!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00038=Use caution Commander.  August has established a perimeter of anti-air defenses, including long range cannons capable of striking targets in low earth orbit.  These cannons are immensely powerful and will down your Condors with a single hit.  You will need to move in from the west rim of the crater and take your team down on foot.  Your air support's no good in there.  Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00039=Alright, phase five, game time!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00040=Shit, we got Roaches all over our six!  
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00041=Dammit, I have to commit my entire unit to keep'em back or they'll get inside our position and then we're royally fucked!  Davis, I want you to take Eckersman and finish this thing.  Take the civvies right up to August's front door.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00042=Colonel, I'm not trained for that!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00043=You've got the combat experience with these things.  That's a hell of a lot more useful right now than the SFAS any of my men have!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00044=Let's get this done so we can get the hell out of here.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00045=Something's really weird here...ya know.  This brain keeps sending all the flying ones away from here.  With as many as it could have killed us ten times over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00046=Not the kind of thing you'll hear me complaining about.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00047=No seriously, anytime we attack one of their nests...every Roach for miles comes a'callin.  But the brain's sending these away instead.  Look, classified or not, this brain talked to us earlier, it told us-
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00048=Can you people please shut your mouths for three freakin seconds so I can finish this?!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00049=Fine, whatever!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00050=This is Looking Glass to Crystal Peak.  Command code Lexington.  Action code Zulu Omega, over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00051=Action response Trigger Initiative.  Red Code Charlie Niner six two. Over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00052=Three minutes from phase two, over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00053=Hillary wants a word with Backswing Op, Looking Glass, over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00054=Copy that, all comms enabled, over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00055=This is Hillary.  It all rests on your shoulders now.  I know you've all been briefed on the operation.  I also know you have federalized law enforcement personnel on your team.  Just babysit'em because they have more combat experience with the roaches than you do, and you need any edge you can get.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00056=Operation Backswing provides the foundation for every operation for the next six months.  I cannot overstate the consequences for the UPL if it fails.  Do your jobs, and come back alive.  That's an order...Hillary out.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00057=Remember people, if you kill any roaches, make sure zero pus bags clear the area.  Intel believes August uses the pus bags to talk to the worker bees.  If any of'em survive, they'll bring back help...and lots of it.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00058=Pus bags are those huge blimps right? 
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00059=Dammit officer you were supposed to read the reference log on the way up here!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00060=I'll take that as a yes, and no problem.  I may not know what you guys call'em, but I can show ya how to kill'em.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00061=God damn, how the hell are we gonna get through that?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00062=Alright cops, you're up....you, Davis, what the hell do we do now?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00063=Well you can't just go in and fight' em; if you kill even one of them, the entire lot will come running.  We need to draw them off first, then run through.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00064=Listen, send in one of your best to the oven at the northeast corner of the nest.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00065=The screamer tower?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00066=The tall thing...don't know what you call it.  Sneak over there and blow it up.  All the Roaches will run over to find out what happened except two or three sentries.  They'll stay behind to guard the workers.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00067=We'll have about 30 seconds to take out the sentries and get clear of the Fungus before the rest come back.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00068=Trask, do it.  Everyone else, we hold until Davis gives the word.  Then we run like hell to the other side.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00069=Ten Star to Wrench, the canteen's in the river, over.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00070=Fill it up.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00071=It's now or never hoss.  One thing I forgot to tell you...do not kill the workers.  Every roach in five miles will swarm here if you do.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00072=You heard her, leave the workers the hell alone.  Move...move!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00073=You...You are the one called... Commander.  And you...you are Officer...Davis...two of my most worthy adversaries, on an otherwise uninteresting planet.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00074=Wait what?  You...talk?  What did you do with Trask?  Where is he?!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00075=I speak to you now through the mind of my child. My preference has been to use your species as sustenance for my warriors, but with your ilk so near to me now, I could not help but bring one of you into my brood instead, the one which referred to itself as Trask, the one you...abandoned.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00076=Be assured, your human is now at peace among my children, and will never be abandoned, again. It is part of me now, and through it, I see its memories. I know why you have come here, and I will enjoy watching you flounder as you attempt to deliver your master stroke. If you survive, that is.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00077=Commander, we're reading you.  This is the first recorded instance of direct communication with the roaches and the first recorded instance of human infestation.  Kill this creature and ensure you yourselves are not compromised like Trask was.  We'll gather what additional intelligence we can during your engagement to try and help you.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00078=What the hell is this thing?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00079=Oh wow...I saw this thing on satellite photos but never...I never thought it was...I mean this is...enormous.
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00080=So let me see if I understand this right.  You're going to drill through its outer shell, plant the nukes, seal it up, and detonate?  How long do we have to get clear before the nuke goes off?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00081=Officer, I can't concentrate with you asking questions okay.  You're here to keep me safe.  I'm here to kill this thing.  Think you can handle your end of it?
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00082=Alright, done...I'm done!  Colonel Gideon you can send the all clear to Defense Net.  Let's get the hell out of here!
Conversation/EP01M07/Line00083=This is as far as we go people!  Any closer and the Smokers'll rip us a new one.  August knows we're here so be sure you're listenin cause I'm only saying this one time.  At least two civvies need to reach the end zone.  Everyone else, including me, is expendable!

Conversation/EP01M08/Line00001=Sealed inside August's shell, the nuclear package should have scattered its brain three miles in every direction.  It didn't.  How little humanity knew at the time, this thing, this roach intelligence, was just a servant of a greater power living 60,000 light years away.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00002=Humankind would later come to know of that supreme intelligence as the Overmind, a beast which pledged to restore life to its fallen servants in exchange for their unconditional loyalty.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00003=That's why August only had a token resistance in the nest; it knew we couldn't kill it.  
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00004=UPL figured out later that August sent most of its swarm out of the area when we got close... like it knew about the nuke or something. 
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00005=Not that it matters, we could have blown up August a thousand times, the Overmind would have kept propping it right back up.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00006=That didn't stop us though. As long as there was a gun in someone's hand, we were going to fight. Hell i'd have fought the things with my bare hands if i could. With Earth already having more roaches than humans after a week, governments around the world knew it was a pitched battle, but they gathered their armies into the biggest urban centers for a final operation in spite of that. It was the first time the United Powers League and the Separatists nations cooperated in human history. What was it that aristotle said...a common danger unites the bitterest enemies.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00007=Commander, we did it. I just received word from Defense Net that Houston's colony ships are prepped and they're already boarding civilians.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00008=Rich VIPs first I bet!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00009=Colonel, there is time for you to evacuate and join the Houston garrison as well, sir.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00010=The Commander and I are the only senior officers on the field. Commander, you're on the next Condor to Houston. We'll hold out as long as we've got supplies.  Make the most of the time we give you.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00011=Colonel Graves sir, every officer the UPL can acquire is a necessary asset for the Houston Operation.  I do not understand why you chose to remain in this location.  The aliens will overrun our current position imminently.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00012=CARR, remember what I told you about the eggs, when we were at Lake Michigan?  That's not how I'm going out.  There's no winning this war.  I think somewhere in that nest of wires you call a brain, even you can put two and two together.  At least here, when I die, I die fast. For everyone else, this nightmare's gonna get a whole lot worse.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00013=Ladies and gentlemen, with the failure of Operation Backswing leaking to the public, everyone now knows we've lost this war.  We can't kill the Roach's top tier queen, and we can't destroy these things fast enough to outpace that bitch breeding new ones.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00014=The UPL has green lit Operation Wounded Arrow as its primary contingency plan.  In twenty-four hours, colony ships packed with civvies will be breaking orbit and getting the hell out of this solar system.  And there are forty-nine regiments just like us who are going to make sure that happens.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00015=Each regiment has one job, we keep the Roaches our of the evacuation centers.  Our regional evacuation site is Houston.  Defense Net needs a day or so to prep for the launches.  We're going to give it to them. 
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00016=Colonel Graves sir. Local scanning arrays detect the alien organisms are only a quarter of a kilometer from our perimeter and are moving toward Houston.  I project no more than ninety seconds before they are in range for us to intercept.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00017=This is Colonel Graves to all platoons. Company's stopping by in about a minute or so. CARR, you're on the line for this one. We'll need your firepower.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00018=Get your game faces on people! Every roach dies today!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00019=Commander, I am detecting a large force of the alien organisms' mobile artillery moving toward our positions.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00020=Don't let those spitters flank our men Commander or we lose our footing here!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00022=A crap load of spitters are inbound!  We need artillery support at Charlie Point M, over!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00023=Commander!  Roach blimps on approach!!!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00024=Commander, we need to cut them off before they unload!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00025=CARR, how did you miss the effing blimps on your scanners?!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00026=My onboard scanners are very limited in range Colonel Graves.  I rely on use of amplification nodes which are positioned around this forward operating base to obtain a longer field of view.  The alien organisms appear to have disabled those nodes. 
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00027=So what you're saying is you won't be able to detect anything until it's right on top of us... that's great!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00028=The blimps are unloading!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00029=C.A.R.R., status report, now!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00030=The seismic event is localized to a mobile area that is on a direct path to your physical position, sir. I register this as 4.8 on the-
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00031=That's what I thought! We've got a tunneler!  Bring it down before it puts its payload onto the field!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00032=The tunneler just broke ground!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00033=A second tunneler just hit us at Location Echo!  We need help now!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00034=SCREAAAMMMEERRRS!!!!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00035=Commander, the flying alien organisms are attempting to bypass the defense lines and to destroy our forward operations center. 
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00036=Commander, those Screamers are your number one priority!  If they take out the construction yards the rest of these maggots are going to swarm over our defenses like locusts!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00037=Spiders, the Roaches brought spiders!  Commander, those things are going to rip apart your entire defensive line if you don't take care of'em!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00038=Due to the presence of specialized alien organisms, it is very likely that a queen is nearby.  Commander, if you destroy the queen, it will weaken the forces that are engaging us.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00039=We've got blimps crapping all over us Commander!  
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00040=The blimps are unloading!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00041=Commander the Roach droppings are going to muck up the entire base if you don't take'em down...*ahem* sir.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00042=I've got eyes on a lower queen sir at Alpha Meridian!  She's under heavy escort, over!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00043=Top priority is for you to knock that bitch out of the sky!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00044=A second of the aliens' lower queens has appeared, Commander.  It is being escorted by a group of its largest warriors.  I recommend you engage with long range artillery or aerial counterattack, sir.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00045=We've got another lower queen out here at Beta Landry!  Over!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00046=Commander!  Some of the Roaches'  lower queens just linked up. Three of 'em are on the field with us out here at Beta Landry! They've got a massive escort! We need backup!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00047=Behemoths!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00048=Commander, the largest of the alien organisms' warriors are attempting to break our defensive lines for their lower queens.  I strongly recommend you use a consolidated artillery strike or aerial counterattack, sir.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00049=Commander, we have detected an anomalous radiation signature in a cave south by south-west of your base of operations. It is advised you send a squad to investigate as soon as possible. Due to the Tunneler activity the area, the we estimate a high risk of cavern collapse!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00050=Commander, be advised that tunneler activity is escalating. There could be a cave-in at ANY time, so if you're going to investigate the radiation signature...do it now!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00051=Commander, we've lost all vital readings from your forces inside the cave. It is now impossible to recover what was in there. Return to your primary mission.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00052=Commander, we've lost contact with the forces in the cave carrying the nuclear device, it is now impossible to recover that payload.  It's too bad too, you could have used it.  Defense Net out.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00053=Commander, we've acquired a nuclear warhead!  It should be armed and ready momentarily.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00054=Commander, a cave-in has shut down access to the source of the radiation signature!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00055=Commander, the nuclear missile is armed and ready to fire anytime.  Kill those bastards!
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00056=Commander, your squad is in position and awaiting your orders
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00057=We've got what we came for people, now let's get the hell out of here.
Conversation/EP01M08/Line00058=Behemoth, Behemoth, Behemoth!

Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00001=I am uncertain why you feel the only course is to sever your connection to the Khala. Someone of your stature, Prelate, would have gained an audience with the Conclave. We could have addressed your grievances. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00002=Instead, you are here, a prisoner, and one which the Conclave would just assume see dead. It is fortunate then that I am the one selected to question you.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00003=Execute me and be done with it.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00004=Death is not for you, my old friend. As you said, your future is along a different path, much like the others whose agony is...quite discernable. Of course, I could execute you, and all I need is one question answered. One answer, and you earn your quick death.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00005=And I should take the word of a Judicator?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00006=You presume to question the Judicator's integrity, Rogue?! Those anguished telepathic cries from the other prisoners are nothing compared to what will happen to you if you continue to-
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00007=My reputation precedes me I'm certain. You know I do not tolerate betrayal, and you know that I always keep my word. The choice...is yours.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00008=Surely, you're not going to bargain with this Rogue, Judicator?! Give me time and I'll get the answer to your question without you needing to sully your hands by compromising with this filth... Upon reflection, give me time with this Rogue and I'll get the answer to 'all' of your questions.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00009=Orsus, if you interrupt me again, it will be YOU who I put in a pain amplifier. Now, Rogue, why...did you sever your connection to the Khala?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00010=I was attempting to smuggle some of what you call 'dissidents' off world when my shuttle malfunctioned. And of all the places I could descend, I crashed near a temple that was not marked on our charts. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00011=The persecuted warriors I was transporting perished in the landing, so I ventured inside the temple alone to take shelter and heal my wounds. As I rested, I heard unusual sounds from within and investigated. I do not know the nature of the creature which lays within the bowels of that structure, but when I stumbled upon it...
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00012=What madness is this? What creature?! You are saying there are monsters on Aiur?!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00013=Oh yes, and it is a monster far worse than either of you. I touched its mind, it made me feel powerful, invincible, just as it had with the Protoss who encountered it during the Aeon of Strife. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00014=You expect us to believe that this creature has existed on our world for thousands of cycles, and it was going to bestow upon you power, so you severed your connection with the Khala to keep that power to yourself?!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00015=Oh no. Not at all. I severed my connection to the Khala, to ensure no other Protoss would learn of its existence.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00016=The Preservers can no longer see my memories, so the secret will truly die with me. Others unfortunately mistook my actions as a symbol of defiance of the Khala, and they severed their nerve cords as well. In trying to keep our people away from temptation, I appear to have contributed to the beginnings of a civil war. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00017=That's...fine. That's fine. Thank you, Rogue. I am now overdue to attend a meeting of the Conclave. Orsus will collect the location from you in my absence, and if it proves to be true, you will have your quick death.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00018=You are fortunate, Judicator, my desire to avoid pain exceeds my adherence to my principles. I shall give you the location of this creature gladly, if you wish to speak with it, you can reap the consequences.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00019=Yes, I believe that...is a foregone conclusion. Orsus, collect the location. I do expect once I validate the information...you will ensure his suffering ends swiftly.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00020=Of course, Judicator.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00021=Monsters, eh Rogue? Tell me then, do you know anything 'else' that might be of interest to a Templar such as myself? I've heard the other Rogues practice forbidden magic, such as creating archons of more than just two personalities. Or harnessing void energies. For your sake, I hope the stories are true. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00023=And I presume that while you verify the information, this Templar wretch will still torture me like he has the others?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00024=Oh, they are... They all are. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00025=Attention unlisted flight, this is Tau Ceti pad three. You are not cleared for landing.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00026=Attention unlisted flight, you are not permitted to land. Hold position or you will be fired upon.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00027=This is pad three to admin. We are under fire here, repeat we are under fire here! Where are you guys?! We are under attack!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00028=I'll ask you this one time. Where is Doran Routhe?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00029=I have no idea who that person is.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00030=Commander, my team is moving further in for recon. We had to travel light for weight limits. If you need any resources, just hit one of the local storehouses. I've got the latest intel marked for you.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00031=One more thing, if you see a CARR unit, take it out quick. It's got nano-regen capability and will heal up fast if you don't. Now let's get this murdering SOB!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00032=What in the name of...we've got hostiles, we've got hostiles!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00033=Infantry are good all-purpose soldiers, Commander, but for heavy ground assault, you'll need some gunners too.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00034=Alright looking good. We're moving to radio silence. Routhe is around here somewhere. And we're gonna bring him back to earth in pieces for what he did. Just keep their fire teams off our back so we can zero him. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00035=Did I miss something? This place is already torched. Did the SCOUTS get it before we did?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00036=Commander, my team just hit the first power distribution node and it was wasted before we got there. Not sure what's going on, but I think we're not the only ones looking for this guy. Let's make sure we get to him first. 
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00037=CARR UNIT!!! TAKE IT DOWN!!!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00038=CARR UNIT!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00039=Dammit these guys are ahead of us every step!... Well it doesn't matter, they're dead.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00040=What the...Commander...what am I looking at?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00041=Preator Mallock, more humans have discovered us at the second seeding site. How should we proceed?
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00042=I understand. All warriors, destroy them!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00043=Take'em down!!!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00044=Alright people! The Commander says we've got some extraterrestrials on this rock and they're inbound! Get on the line now! Whatever they are we're gonna blow'em back to where they came from!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00045=These things ain't so tough! Commander we should push out and hit'em on their flank!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00047=Forgive us for what we must do for our people. For Adun!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00048=Praetor Mallock, the third seeding site is secure. We MUST depart before the creatures arrive. The next world is on the periphery of these humans' home solar system. Even a Bengalaas can follow the trail of crumbs we are leaving.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00049=Next target's the ammunition depot, Commander. We take that out, there's no way these dirt farmers can mount a defense when we hit the underground facilities.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00050=Fire in the Hole!
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00051=The path is clear, if these creatures are allowed live, they will report our presence with great zeal. Destroy them, Destroy all of them! Our mission can not be compromised.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00052=Condor reporting.
Conversation/EP01Prologue/Line00053=Mayday! Mayday!!
