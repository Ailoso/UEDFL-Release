Conversation/EP01M04/Line00034=Commander, the UPL provides three structures which possess combat capabilities.  The first is an electro-static defense tower or E.S.T.  You will see several of these already in place inside of our perimeter.  The other two structures, the Nightjar and Solitaire, are not available for construction until our connection to the UPL Datanet is restored.
