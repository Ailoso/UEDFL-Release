LoadingScreen/TextBody=Continued alien attacks forced the United Powers League (UPL)<n/>to evacuate most civilian centers which created<n/>hundreds of millions of displaced refugees all over the globe.  <n/><n/>Agricultural and factory farm centers were very hard hit<n/>at the outset of the alien invasion leaving food in very short supply.<n/><n/>The UPL had marshalled its resources and initiated <n/>Operation Elpis, a coordinated world-wide <n/>counter-offensive against the invaders. <n/><n/>The UPL scored several key victories including the destruction of<n/>a major alien breeding center and turning away attacks <n/>against several key locations including London, Johannesburg, and Beijing. 
LoadingScreen/Tip=Units trapped in a flash fog event have visibility drop to near zero.  Trapped units can escape the fog by moving to higher ground.
LoadingScreen/TipRestart=Electrostatic Defense Towers have a shorter range than most auto-defense systems, but a higher damage output when enemies come into that range.

Field commanders typically utilize the shields to position Z-1s in front of a troop formation, allowing those suits to deflect large amounts of incoming enemy fire while forces behind them can freely engage the enemy.<n/><n/>Use of the shield ability slows a Z-1 down considerably, and prevents the pilot from taking any other actions until they return to active combat mode.

Param/Value/E3B2A330=<c val="FFFF00">Flash Fog</c> is a fog that forms very suddenly and disappears just as quickly.  In order for fog to form at all, some type of dust or pollution must exist in the air around which water vapor can condense.  The roaches have flooded the air with particulates as part of their nesting processes.  That, combined with this region's humidity and temperature, is the perfect recipe for fog to form almost instantly.<n/><n/>Flash fog poses a tactical problem for UPL forces due to the inability to detect roaches at all using instrumentation.  Thermographics are ineffective.  Bioelectric tracking only functions at extremely short ranges.  And roaches don't appear at all on any enhanced vision apparatus deployed by the UPL.  Literally, UPL forces are limited to visual range.  With thick flash fog, that visual range drops to near zero.  Roaches appear to rely more on their olfactory then visual senses, allowing them to effectively hunt, fog or not. <n/><n/>If UPL forces encounter roaches in a fogged area, the roaches will be able to attack and UPL forces will not. <c val="FFFF00"> IT IS IMPERATIVE</c> that UPL forces remain above the fogged valleys during any flash fog event, to ensure that deployed forces are not annihilated in the field.
