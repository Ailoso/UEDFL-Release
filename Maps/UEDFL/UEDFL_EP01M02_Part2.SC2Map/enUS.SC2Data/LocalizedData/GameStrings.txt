Find two containers of ammonia that are part of the sewage filtration system and set them near the debris.  Once both are in place, ignite the containers and the path should be cleared.  The UPL bombings have already weakened the load bearing structures of the sewers, and any additional explosions might collapse the entire system.  After you use the explosives, exit as quickly as you can.<n/><n/>Due to their weight, you can only carry one ammonia container at a time.

The UPL Engineering Corps is attempting to burrow through from inside the tunnel.  In the meantime, Commander, you have a tactical option.<n/><n/>The roads in and out of the tunnel are flanked by high ground resting areas.  If you station your troops on these ridges, you can attack the creatures without fear of return fire (at least from ground level).  Just be careful of the flying ones.  It is your option, Commander, and Defense Net will support you if you choose instead to engage the creatures head-on.  The creatures are attacking in waves, so you will have time to reinforce your high-ground positions between those waves.  Optimal high-ground troop deployment locations are marked on your minimap.

Param/Value/BB2E3E38=Commander, we have engineers on the other side of the south tunnel entrance working to excavate the debris.  We cannot set charges or we risk collapsing the tunnel entirely.  You will need to keep the civilians safe until we open the roads.  Our spotters show the enemy is entering the northern tunnel in waves.

Param/Value/FF250427=<c val="FFFF00">Electrostatic Defense Towers (ESD) </c>are stationary short-range automatic defense systems.  These structures will discharge concentrated bolts of electricity at a target in rapid succession.<n/><n/>While lightning bolts often have voltage of 300 million vs the 10 million from an ESD, bolts from both sources in a direct strike have the same effect with flashover (the electricity passing over the skin) deflecting much of the energy and relatively little current passing through the body.  This means the targets are cooked alive vs being electrocuted. 
Param/Value/FFCB057D=Without a headquarters, you are unable to manufacture mining drones.  While in normal operations, you can simply rebuild a headquarters that is destroyed, in this outpost there will be insufficient power available to start new construction due to pressure on the city grid.  The emergency generator can keep the headquarters running but can't handle power draw requirements for construction.
