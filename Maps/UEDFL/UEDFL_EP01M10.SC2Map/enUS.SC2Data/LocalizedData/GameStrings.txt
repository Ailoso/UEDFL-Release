Param/Value/04D8421E=The roaches answered the question, right?  Ya know...whether we're alone in the universe?  UPL's confidence is high that there might be other life forms out there too.  Maybe some of them hate the roaches as much as we do.  We're using the S.E.T.I. dishes to broadcast the S.O.S.  We're uploading the message here and piping it out into space up north.  Ever since you rescued me from Tampa, I've been working twenty hours a day putting the message together...in a format most likely to be understood by an extraterrestrial intelligence.
Param/Value/05A0B911=Commander, there's no telling what those things screwed up in here.  Cross your fingers the systems I need are still online when we find them.  Cross your toes too if you think it will help.
Param/Value/0C68F2B7=The UPL must have abandoned this base when things went South. Do you need to call Defense Net?
Param/Value/0D19FE5B=These UPL military structures and the cubic buttload of minerals scattered around here?  Just thinking out loud.

Param/Value/16C6CB5C=Silent Approach
Param/Value/1A07B0BF=Fine, your highness, have it your way.  Commander, let's lure the roaches out of the building instead.  There's a fuel truck parked one building away,  I saw it when the Condor flew in my team.  If we light it up, the explosion should be loud enough to bring every roach in the campus running, including whatever's in this place.

Param/Value/3977660A=Ma'am, if you're done we need to get you back to our fallback position.
Param/Value/3A3A2730=The scattered minerals you mentioned must have fallen off the trucks as they were being hauled away during the withdrawal.  If you can restore emergency power to the campus, you can get those facilities working for you.  You won't be able to get more troops or vehicles on the field as we have no personnel in your area, but you can build turrets to hold key positions on the campus and you should be able to fabricate a CARR unit.   
Param/Value/3C7F0044=Commander, the moment that generator goes offline, everything here is a dead stick.  If you're gonna sweep this place, do it fast.  And Commander, you can't fire your weapons in there.  
Param/Value/3CF081FD=Right.  Commander, the comm channel is open, sir.

Param/Value/57802EE6=Hey Doc, good luck, see ya on the other side.  And Commander, you and the UPL can...you know.
Param/Value/58460C1E=And Commander, of all the people to live through this thing, I'd never have expected it to be a bureaucrat like you.  I wish I could say it's good to see you again so I will.  
Param/Value/5F0F5BC6=I'd rather not put my own ass on the line if I can't fight back, so either we clear the place out or you go in alone.
Param/Value/5F2350B9=If the generator is destroyed, the facility loses power and you mission cannot be completed.

Param/Value/6338FB42=<c val="FF0000">Roaches are about to enter the building!</c>
Param/Value/637BB007=The UPL left emergency generators behind after evacuating the facility.  The power grid is long dead across most of the world and roach particulates in the air are blocking out substantial sunlight, rendering solar panels largely useless.  The archaic diesel generator is the best option you have.
Param/Value/64C02F26=Oh shit!
Param/Value/65134A58=Thank you, Commander.  This is definitely the place.  I'll let you know as soon as I've rebooted the mainframe and I'm into the network.
Param/Value/65CA6AF8=Commander, while the doc's in there messing with the computers, I've seen a bunch of trees moving on the hill.  Either something really big or a lot of something small is inbound.  They're way off, but they're B lining right to us.  Figured ya might be interested in that little factoid.
Param/Value/65CCA048=Commander, our ability to encrypt communications has been compromised due to attacks against our infrastructure.  This and future messages are being transmitted in the open.  The VIP that you rescued a few days ago is an exo-linguist.  She will be joining you momentarily.  You need to ensure the landing site is secure.  Defense Net out.

Param/Value/68A2B707=Special Ops
Param/Value/6A593769=Looks like these things are running on empty. From the fuel meter I'd say we have half an hour before the generator goes dark for good.
Param/Value/6AFDCD20=Secure the landing site for the Condors
Param/Value/6C021936=I'll give you the full skinny Commander I promise.  Right now I'd just like to get off the street.  My plan needs power, and the S.E.T.I. facility has diesel backup gennies.  We need to get those online.

Param/Value/7784A542=Research Building
Param/Value/789AE3EB=In the event Operation Elpis ended in failure, the UPL has one other contingency plan.  Dr. Halsey has tactical command.  Follow her lead.

Param/Value/7FDCDF24=Dr. Halsey
Param/Value/825A4589=S.E.T.I. had a local mainframe much closer to the dishes but UPL accidentally blew it up on a strafing run.  So...this facility's the backup.  
Param/Value/82A285C8=We need support in the quad, now!
Param/Value/8A460F98=We're in Commander, and we can still talk to the dishes!
Param/Value/8BFFD17B=Diesel Backup Generator
Param/Value/8CCE69DD=Hey doc, don't get too comfy in your new digs.  Those huge behemoth things are dug in all over the place and there's worms slitherin around.  They've been pretty calm ever since we holed up in that office building but with that generator you just turned on, I'm sure every roach in a mile's gonna hear us so strap in.
Param/Value/8DF337BD=Mountain View, California
Param/Value/8EA2FD69=Guess they know we're here.  What a shocker...I don't think we could be making any more noise if we tried.
Param/Value/8F5589DC=Nice to see you again, Commander.
Param/Value/92DE3C35=Those ships were probably the first sign of life in this neighborhood for days.  I'm sure every roach in Mountain View is gonna be rushing over here to check out the commotion.
Param/Value/933FE9F6=The generator has very limited fuel and there's no resupply.  Once the generator is down, you permanently lose power to the facility.
Param/Value/96A14E8A=Dr Halsey Arrives In:
Param/Value/978E7915=Roaches
Param/Value/990C5A7F=Call command about what?
Param/Value/9F0F8D62=I know, Commander, no pressure right?  I promise I'll explain what's going on but I need you to get me to the northwest building first.  Now that we have power, I need to see if the mainframe's still working.  We can't achieve mission success without it.

Param/Value/D2C32351=Bring Dr. Halsey to the research building
Param/Value/D579FCCE=Most of the UPL Defense Forces have been destroyed or our Command and Control has completely broken down in the field so we can't coordinate with the rest of our troops, at least those who haven't deserted anyhow.  We'll keep this channel open as long as we can...we expect to lose comms any moment as the roaches destroy what little remains of our infrastructure.
Param/Value/D830CA64=Use This <n/>Computer
Param/Value/D85C5503=UPL Defense Net
Param/Value/DC3E6AFB=A promise is a promise.  Here's the rundown for you Commander.  It's a pretty simple operation.  We are calling for help.  This S.E.T.I. facility will let us control the large broadcast dishes up in Northern Cali.  The dishes are in a pretty isolated area, but UPL already has some troops there in case the roaches start poking around.
Param/Value/DD4ED78F=The roaches have infested the entire area, and will investigate unfamiliar noises.  The more noise you make on your way to the LZ, the more roaches are likely to appear.  Killing roaches creates minimal noise, throwing grenades creates a lot of noise as does destroying roach structures.  When noise draws roaches to your location, do your best to eliminate the scouts before advancing.  Prolonged battles will almost certainly result in you being overwhelmed.<n/><n/>Keep your noise level below 9 and you will likely avoid roaches showing up to investigate your activity.  If roaches are looking for you, do your best to kill them with only rifles.  Noise levels will drop periodically when you're not in combat.
Param/Value/DE8FBBF8=S.E.T.I. Institute Campus
Param/Value/E651D0DA=Defense Net said if anyone can help guide us through this mission it's you, and Myra trusted you too.  I don't.  But I'll still follow your lead.
Param/Value/E79D3AFE=You have destroyed quantities of roaches and flown in two transport ships in the past half hour.  The roaches are agitated and are actively massing patrols of conflict zones.  <n/><n/>Too little, too late, the UPL was able to break through the roach airborne particulate interference to leverage what's left of the satellite grid to track roach movements at long distances.  While bioelectric signatures could be detected as well, that only functions at extremely short range and is limited in its usefulness.<n/><n/>Satellites will provide you with locations for large groups of roaches so that you can determine whether or not you want to avoid them.  It is recommended you do until you are able to acquire heavier firepower.
Param/Value/E993AE5E=Uh, doc, I'm not sure you want to go in there.  Some nutjob, Harrison I think his name was, snapped, like lost it, and ran in there a couple hours ago.
Param/Value/E9A95157=UPL Defense Net
Param/Value/ED86FF9E=Commander, in addition to checking the status of the mainframe in the northwest building, there are <c val="FF0000">more tasks to complete before you lose generator power</c>.  Leave yourself at least twelve minutes of fuel time after you check the mainframe.  Please note that checking on the mainframe will require several minutes as well.
Param/Value/EFA0EBB8=Sir, you need to keep your voice down and step away from that console right now!

Param/Value/F7C03ADD=Roaches killed Dr Halsey
Param/Value/F8D017A7=Generator Fuel Expires In:
Param/Value/F8E38DB5=Commander, we just received word that our land link is about to be severed.  Two Condors picked up on your chatter and volunteered to assist, so help is incoming.  We are going to monitor-  
Param/Value/FDAD3C57=Well...there it is, Commander.  I'm so sorry sir.
Param/Value/FEFBB482=Dr. Halsey needs to get into the northwest mainframe building.  She hasn't said why but she has tactical command so those are your orders, Commander.
