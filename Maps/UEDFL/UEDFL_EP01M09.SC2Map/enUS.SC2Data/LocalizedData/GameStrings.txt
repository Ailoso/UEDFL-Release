DocInfo/Name=Abandon Hope
LoadingScreen/TextBody=   UPL forces established perimeters around Houston, Texas and <n/>   other mostly intact urban centers while enormous colony ships <n/>   inside were boarded by hundreds of people each.  The ships <n/>   all had a different destination star system, many light <n/>   years from Sol.<n/><n/>   To stall the Roaches' advance during the evacuation, the UPL<n/>   unleashed its nuclear stockpiles on nests all over the world.  <n/>   Though irradiating much of the earth in the process, the attacks <n/>   significantly depleted the Roaches' numbers and their ability <n/>   to wage war.<n/><n/>   With our cyber-infrastructure in ruins, information was conveyed<n/>   to the remaining human populations via short wave radio, <n/>   analog broadcasts, and even hard copy newspapers.
LoadingScreen/Tip=Defilers can paralyze civilians and any infantry unit not equipped with a self-contained breathing apparatus.
LoadingScreen/TipRestart=Harvest human civilians to build more warriors and structures.
